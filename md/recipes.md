Almond Chocolate Torte
----------------------

Yield: one 9-inch cake
(10 to 12 servings)

> This recipe is from the March/April 2001 issue of "Quick
> Cooking" magazine.  It was submitted by Rhonda Lanterman of
> Terrace, British Columbia.  I think that "torte" is not really
> the right term; this is sort of halfway between a chocolate
> cheesecake and a chocolate mousse pie.  The almonds look nice,
> but don't really add anything otherwise — you probably do need
> to have something on the bottom to keep it from sticking to the
> pan, anyway.  This might make a good creampuff filling, too.
> It's not really all that quick; this was in the "Company's
> Coming" feature.  But, at least it doesn't have to be baked.

- 2/3 cup sliced almonds, toasted
- 8 ounces semisweet chocolate
- 2 8-ounce packages of cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 envelope unflavored gelatin
- 1/4 cup cold water
- 2 cups whipping cream, whipped


First off, you need to toast the almonds, whip the cream, and soften
the cream cheese.  Set aside 1 tablespoon of attractive almond
slices for the garnish.  Sprinkle the rest into a greased 9 or 9-1/2
inch springform pan.  Melt the chocolate, stir until smooth, and set
aside.  Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and
sugar.  In a (very) small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over cold
water; let stand 1 minute, then cook and stir over low heat until
the gelatin is completely dissolved.  Beat into cream cheese
mixture.  Add melted chocolate and beat until blended.  fold in the
whipped cream.  "Pour" into prepared pan.  Sprinkle with reserved
almonds.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving.


Angel Wings
-----------

Yield: about 4 dozen

> This recipe came from "The Christmas Cookie Jar", an insert in
> the 11/16/04 edition of "Woman's Day" magazine.  My heart cookie
> cutter wasn't as big as the one specified in the recipe, so I
> skipped the almond-slice "feathers" and just sprinkled them with
> white sugar.  These are probably best made on a traditional
> cookie sheet instead on an air-bake sheet; I think they don't
> puff enough on the air-bake sheet and so, come out harder.

- 1/2 cup butter, softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
- 1+2/3 cups flour
- 1/4 cup cornstarch

Decoration:
- 1 egg white
- sliced almonds
- sugar

Beat butter, sugar, and baking powder in a large bowl on low
speed.  Increase speed to medium-high and continue beating until
fluffy.  Beat in egg and almond extract.  On low speec, beat in
flour and cornstarch until just blended.  Divide dough in half,
shape each portion into a 1-inch-thick disk, wrap individually,
and refrigerate until firm enough to roll out (4 hours or so).
Working with one disk at a time, roll out on waxed paper to 1/8
inch thick and cut out hearts with a 2.5-inch heart-shaped
cookie cutter.  Slide the paper onto a baking sheet and freeze
5 to 10 minutes until firm and easy to handle.  Peel the hearts
off the paper and place them 1 inch apart on an ungreased
baking sheet.  Cut a 1.5-inch-long slit at the bottom of
each heart and spread apart gently to form wings.  Brush hearts
with egg white, attach three almond slices on each side of the
wing to represent the feathers, and sprinkle with sugar.  Bake
at 350°F. for 8–10 minutes until golden brown at the
edges.  (Reroll the scraps only once, or cookies will be tough.)


Apple Raisin Muffins
--------------------

Yield: about 1 dozen

> This recipe comes from "Campbell's Kitchen".  It works equally
> well with dried cranberries instead of raisins.  The original
> recipe calls for peeling the apples before dicing them; I've
> found that that's not really necessary.  The original also
> suggests optionally adding 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.

- 3/4 cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1+1/2 cups diced apples
- 1/2 cup raisins

Combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in a medium
bowl.  Beat the oil and sugar in another larger bowl until they
are completely mixed; add the eggs and vanilla extract and beat
for 1 minute.  Add the dry ingredients and stir until just
combined.  Fold in the diced apples and raisins.  Spoon into
muffin cups and bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, or until
a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.


Apricot Raisin Chutney
----------------------

Yield: about 2.5 cups

> I clipped this recipe from an organic food catalog, although I don't
> use organic ingredients.  This is really about half of the original
> recipe, but it makes more than a pint, which is all I want to keep
> on hand at a time.  We like chutney to help dress up oven-baked
> breaded fish or chicken cutlets; it's also used in the sauce for
>"Curried Chicken Meatballs".  The original recipe just said "dried
> apricots", but we prefer a less-chunky chutney, so I chop them.

- 1/2 pound dried apricots, chopped
- 1/8 cup garlic, chopped
- 1/4 cup onion, chopped
- 1+1/2 tablespoons crystallized ginger, chopped
- 3/4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- Salt
- 1/2 cup raisins

Soak the apricots in 4 cups hot water for at least one hour or
overnight.  Bring the apricots to a boil and add garlic, onion,
ginger, vinegar, curry, and a pinch of salt.  Simmer until the
mixture is thick.  Add raisins and cook for another 20 minutes.
Stir occasionally, making sure chutney does not stick.  Cool; store
in refrigerator.


Ballymaloe Brown Bread
----------------------

Yield: one loaf

> I clipped this recipe from the Washington Post years ago.  It's
> reminiscent of the brown bread we were served in Ireland, and my
> husband especially likes it toasted.  The recipe originally called
> for a lot of salt (I think it was 2 tablespoons!); I have reduced
> it.  This bread is best when made with a coarsely ground whole wheat
> flour.  If all I can find is the finely ground kind (Pillsbury, for
> instance), I reduce the flour to about 3+1/2 cups and add a handful
> or two of oat bran.  Wheat germ would be another possible addition
> to improve the texture.

- 3+3/4 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons molasses
- 1+1/2 cups warm water, divided
- 1+1/2 packages dry yeast (a package = 2+1/2 teaspoons)

Mix molasses, 1/2 cup warm water, yeast.  Let rise 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, grease a loaf pan well.  In a large bowl, mix the flour
and salt (and bran, if used).  Add the yeast mixture and the
remaining cup of warm water to the flour and mix well.  (You will
almost certainly have to add more water to achieve this.) The recipe
says that the dough should be "just too wet to knead"; but it then
says to "pour it into the greased pan", which implies a much wetter
dough than you have.  It's more a matter of pushing the dough into
the pan.  Cover and let rise 20 minutes.  (In the winter, this might
take a bit longer — maybe 25 minutes.) The recipe then says to bake
"in a 450°F oven for 50 minutes".  Unless your equipment is
much different from mine, that will burn your bread to a crisp.  I
find that 375 to 400 degrees and 25 to 30 minutes is plenty.  When
the bread is done, immediately remove it from the pan and place on a
wire rack to cool.  While the bread is still hot, I rub some butter
over the top crust, to make it easier to slice.


Banana Chocolate Chip Muffins
-----------------------------

Yield: about 10 cupcake-sized muffins

> (This recipe was contributed by my son, Arthur.)
> I got this recipe from Cooks.com. It's a half-recipe; the original
> called for 4 bananas. Instead of half of 1/3 cup milk, I use half
> of a quarter-cup; the original makes fairly wet and heavy muffins
> already. You can substitute apple cider vinegar for the lemon juice.
> It's there only to acidify the wet ingredients anyway.

- 1 cup flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- dash of salt
- 1/4 cup butter, softened
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 egg
- 2 ripe bananas
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips

Cream the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl, then add the
vanilla, egg, and mashed bananas; mix well. Add the lemon juice
and milk to the wet mixture. Meanwhile, mix the flour, baking soda,
cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl; then stir the dry mixture
into the wet mixture. Fold in the chocolate chips. Spoon into
muffin tins and bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.


Black Forest Cookies
--------------------

Yield: about 5 dozen

> This recipe came from "The Christmas Cookie Jar", an insert in
> the 11/16/04 edition of "Woman's Day" magazine.  Although the
> recipe specifies a frosting for the cookies, I've never bothered
> with that.  These are very chocolaty cookies with a fairly soft
> texture.  You may need more than a 10-oz jar of cherries to get
> enough chopped cherries for the recipe, especially if you want
> to make the frosting (or maybe just have not quite so many
> cherries in the cookies).  There's no need to refrigerate the
> cookies if you don't frost them.

- 2+1/2 cups flour
- 1/4 cup cocoa
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup butter (2 sticks)
- 1+1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips, divided
- 1 cup packed light brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 10-ounce jar maraschino cherries (or maybe more)

Frosting (optional):
- 6 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1/3 cup marshmallow cream (fluff)
- 2 cups confectioners' sugar
- 2 tablespoons maraschino cherry juice
- 1/4 cups chopped maraschino cherries

Drain the cherries, reserving 2 tablespoons juice for the
frosting, if you're going to make it.  Dry the cherries on
paper towels, then chop them — you need 1+1/4 cups of chopped
cherries for the cookies themselves, and 1/4 cup more for the
frosting.

Whisk flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl
until well blended.  Melt the butter and 1 cup of the chocolate
chips in a medium saucepan over low heat, stirring often, just
until melted.  Remove from heat and let cool for 10 minutes.

Whisk in sugar, then eggs and vanilla, until well-blended.  Add
the flour mixture and stir until smooth, then stir in the 1+1/4
cups of chopped cherries and the remaining 1/2 cup chocolate
chips. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough 2 inches apart on an
ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake 10 to 12 minutes, until firm when
gently pressed.  Remove to rack to cool completely.

For frosting: place butter, marshmallow fluff, confectioners'
sugar, and cherry juice in a medium bowl; beat on medium-low
speed unti fluffy, and stir in chopped cherries.  Spread about
1+1/2 teaspoons frosting on each cookie and let set about
2 hours.  Refrigerate with waxed paper between layers for
up to one week.


Blueberry Kuchen
----------------

Yield: one 9-inch tart

> I no longer remember where I got this recipe — probably from a
> newspaper.  Although it is called a "kuchen", I think it would
> be better described as a "tart".  In fact, I have seen a similar
> recipe using both blueberries and raspberries and called "Two-Berry
> Tart".  This is a favorite summertime treat.

- 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour, divided
- 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, divided
- pinch of salt
- 1/2 cup butter
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar
- 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
- 3 cups fresh or dry-pack frozen blueberries, thawed
- confectioners' sugar or whipped cream (or both!)

Crust:  Mix 1 cup flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, and the salt.  Cut
in the butter with a pastry blender or fingers.  Mix in the
vinegar.  Pat out on the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of a
9-inch loose-bottom layer-cake pan (or a "springform pan").

Filling:  Mix remaining 1 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, and the
cinnamon.  Next, the original recipe says to combine that with 2
cups of the blueberries and turn out into the pan.  I find it
easier to distribute the blueberries and sugar evenly if I don't
combine them.  Instead, I sprinkle some of the sugar mixture over
the crust, then distribute the 2 cups of blueberries, then
sprinkle the remaining sugar mixture over top.

Bake about 1 hour in a 400°F oven.  Remove from the oven,
sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup of blueberries.  Cool, then
remove the rim of the pan.  Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar
and/or garnish with whipped cream before serving.


Buttermilk Pralines
-------------------

Yield: 1+1/2 pounds

> This recipe originally came from Taste of Home, although I have
> appended some modifications based on some other recipes. Make
> these on a day with humidity no higher than 60 percent.

- 2 cups sugar
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons light corn syrup (optional)
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1+1/2 cups pecan halves, very coarsely chopped
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

In a large heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, buttermilk, baking soda,
salt, and corn syrup. Cook and stir over medium heat until a candy
thermometer reads 210°F.

Stir in butter and pecans; cook until thermometer reads 230°.
Remove from the heat; add vanilla. Beat with a wooden spoon until
mixture loses its gloss and begins to set, about 8 minutes. Quickly
drop by teaspoonfuls onto foil-lined baking sheets. Cool.

Alternatives to try:

Rub a stick of butter around the inside of the pan to make a 2-inch wide
ring around the pan 4 inches up from the bottom.  (Helps prevent boiling
too high and also helps prevent sugar crystals.)

Use a stick of butter; put everything except pecans and vanilla in at
the start. Cook over low heat until sugar dissolves, then over medium,
stirring only occasionally until 230 degrees.  Remove from heat, add
pecans and vanilla, and stir gently and slowly until the pecans are coated.
Then continue to stir slowly just until syrup starts to thicken and becomes
less translucent. Drop by tablespoons onto prepared sheets.


Carrot Casserole
----------------

Yield: 4 servings

> We have this dish for Thanksgiving every year, in memory of my
> mother-in-law, who gave me the recipe.  The carrots give it some
> redeeming nutritive value, although it is otherwise decadent.

- 4 cups carrots, cut up
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/2 cup Velveeta cheese chunks
- 1/4 cup onion, minced
- 1/4 cup butter, diced
- 1/2 cup corn flake or potato chip crumbs

Cook the carrots with the sugar in a small amount of water, until
they are tender.  Drain the carrots and place them in a buttered
casserole dish.  Top with the cheese, onion, and butter.  Sprinkle
with crumbs and bake at 350°F for about 30 minutes.


Cheesecake Brownies
-------------------

Yield: one 9x13 pan

> This recipe came from Matt Reynolds' girlfriend Jen Fenske.

Brownies:
- 4 ounces unsweetened baker's chocolate
- 1 cup butter
- 4 eggs
- 3 teaspoons vanilla
- 1 cup flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups sugar

Cheesecake topping:
- 8 ounces cream cheese
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 egg
- 2 teaspoons vanilla
- 1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk

Preheat the oven to 350°F and grease a 9x13 pan.
Combine flour, sugar, and salt in a mixer. Add eggs and vanilla.
In a saucepan, melt the butter and chocolate together. Once the mixture is
thoroughly melted, add it to the mixer and blend.
Add nuts, chocolate chips, coconut, or whatever else your heart desires.
Pour into the greased pan and bake for 20 to 25 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare the cheesecake topping: Combine everything except the
condensed milk and mix until creamy. Slowly mix in the condensed milk.
I usually let the mix whip for just a few minutes after everything is blended.
Once the brownies have baked for 20 to 25 minutes, pour the topping onto the
brownies and bake for an additional 30 to 35 minutes at 350°F.

Top with drizzles of melted chocolate, or one of my favorites is to pipe
Nutella in decorative patterns.


Coconut Cashew Basmati Rice Salad
---------------------------------

Yield: 9 cups

> This recipe came from the 8/3/04 issue of "Family Circle"
> magazine.  It's a good dish to take to a potluck, since it's
> OK at any temperature — the original instructions say "Can
> be made a few hours ahead, covered, and left at room temperature.
> Leftovers can be refrigerated and served cold or at room
> temperature."  If you're making it ahead of time, you might
> wait to add the cashews until shortly before serving.(You'll
> probably have to break up lumps after refrigeration, anyway.)

- 3 tablespoons mild vegetable oil
- 1 medium onion, halved and thinly sliced
- 1 clove garlic, chopped
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
- 1+1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
- 2 cups basmati rice, rinsed several times in cold water and drained well
- 1 can (13.5 to 14 ounces) unsweetened coconut milk (not the same as "cream of coconut")
- black pepper, preferably freshly ground
- 1 cup thinly sliced green onions (about 5)
- 1/2 cup grated fresh or shredded unsweetened dried coconut
- 1/2 cup dry-roasted cashews, very coarsely chopped

Heat the oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-high heat.
Add onion, garlic, and ginger; sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt
and cook, stirring, about 8 minutes until soft (do not brown).
Add rice and cook, stirring, 2 minutes.  Add coconut milk,
2+1/4 cups water, and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper.  Bring
to a boil, then reduce heat to very low, and cook tightly
covered for 15 to 20 minutes or until rice is soft and all
liquid is absorbed.  Transfer to a large serving bowl and
fold in green onions and coconut, fluffing rice and breaking
up any clumps.  Season with 1 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste.
Garnish with cashews; serve hot or at room temperature.

Corned Beef and Cabbage Dinner
------------------------------

Yield: 6 servings

> This recipe came from the Washington Post "Cooking Classics"
> feature many years ago. The primary difference from other
> recipes I've seen is the additional step of baking with a
> brown sugar / mustard topping, which is very tasty. Some other
> recipes include parsnips among the vegetables, and beets --
> although the beets are cooked separately, not in the pot with
> the rest. My husband likes to have a horseradish sauce with
> the cabbage.

- 3 to 4 pound corned beef brisket
- 1/2 medium onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 bay leaves
- 6 medium potatoes, peeled
- 6 small carrots
- 6 cabbage wedges
- 1 teaspoon prepared mustard
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- dash of ground cloves

Place meat in a large pot; add water to cover (about 7 cups).
Add onion, garlic, and bay leaves. Cover and simmer 3 to 4 hours,
until tender. Remove meat, saving cooking liquid.

Add potatoes and carrots to liquid. Cover, bring to a boil, and
cook 5 minutes. Add cabbage and cook 25 minutes longer, or until
the vegetables are tender.

Meanwhile, place meat, fat side up, in a shallow baking pan.
Score through the fat with a knife. Spread with mustard;
sprinkle with mixture of brown sugar and cloves.
Bake at 350°F for 15 minutes.

Serve meat with vegetables; and pass cooking liquid to spoon
atop, if desired.


Country Chicken Casserole
-------------------------

Yield: 6 servings

> This recipe came from "Country Extra" magazine. It was submitted by
> Frances Gleichmann of Baltimore, Maryland. For a 13x9-inch
> pan, I use a double recipe.  The recipe below is as it was printed,
> but I usually make some substitutions.  Instead of light cream, I
> use "Calcimilk", which is a lactose-reduced, calcium-enriched skim
> milk.(That's what I normally have on hand.  You could use regular
> milk.) Also, I find crushing rosemary to be a bother, so I use
> thyme, which we like just as well, but can be used straight out of
> the jar.  I also reduce the amount of onions to about 2/3 of what
> the recipe calls for; that's just a matter of family preference.
> Most of the time I use dried parsley, since I don't usually have
> fresh on hand, and occasionally I substitute chopped red pepper for
> the pimiento — when I do that, I cook the red pepper along with the
> onions and mushrooms.  Usually I make about 50% more bread crumbs
> than the recipe calls for, just because we like them.

- 1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, quartered
- 2 medium onions, chopped
- 5 tablespoons butter (or margarine), divided
- 2 cups cubed cooked chicken
- 2 cups diced cooked peeled potatoes
- 1 jar (2 ounces) pimiento, drained
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
- 1 cup light cream
- 1 teaspoon instant chicken bouillon granules
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
- 1/8 teaspoon pepper
- 1 cup soft bread crumbs
- Additional parsley (optional)

In a skillet, saute the mushrooms and onions in 3 tablespoons
butter until tender.  Add chicken, potatoes, pimiento, parsley,
cream, bouillon, salt rosemary and pepper; heat through.  Spoon
into a greased 2-qt. casserole.  Melt remaining butter, combine
with the bread crumbs and sprinkle over casserole.  Bake,
uncovered, at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until crumbs are
toasted.  Garnish with parsley if desired.


Cream Cheese and Roasted Pecan Cookies
--------------------------------------

Yield: 5 to 7 dozen

> I clipped this recipe from a magazine, but it credited it to "The
> Prudhomme Family Cookbook" by Chef Paul Prudhomme.
> This might be my all-time favorite
> cookie.  (But then, there's the Macadamia Shortbread, and the Honey
> Almond Strips...) Bacause it came from a famous chef, it specifies
> unsalted butter, then adds salt.  I see no reason you can't use
> regular butter and reduce the salt a little.  But, if you're making
> a special trip to the store to get the cream cheese anyway, you may
> as well get the unsalted butter.  Because of his limited vision, my
> husband has trouble distinguishing these cookies from the chocolate
> chip cookies on the cookie tray, so I somethimes add some purple
> (paste) food coloring to help him tell them apart.

- 1+1/2 cups sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 package (3 ounces) cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 2+1/4 cups flour
- 1+1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 cups pecan pieces, toasted

Mix sugar, egg, butter, and cream cheese in a large bowl until
the mixture is creamy and the butter and cheese are small lumps.
Add cocoa, salt, milk, and vanilla.  Add half the flour and the
baking powder, then the rest of the flour.  Stir in pecans.
Drop batter by heaping teaspoonfuls one inch apart on a greased
cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 degrees for 12 to 14 minutes, until
edges are brown.  Remove to rack to cool.  The cookies will be
quite soft while warm, but will crisp as they cool.

Curried Chicken Meatballs
-------------------------

Yield: 32 to 36 meatballs

> This recipe is from the 10/12/93 issue of "Family Circle" magazine.
> It's a ground chicken recipe that my husband and son actually like!
> The recipe claims 8 servings; they must be thinking of it as an
> appetizer, I guess.  I would call it 3 large servings or 4 somewhat
> restrained servings.  Most of the time, I make a double recipe,
> since it is a certain amount of hassle to make, so I want to at
> least get two meals out of it.

Meatballs:
- 1 cup fresh bread crumbs
- 1/3 cup finely chopped green onion
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped almonds
- 1+1/2 teaspoons curry powder
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon pepper
- 1 egg, slightly beaten
- 1 pound ground chicken

Creamy Chutney Sauce:
- 1/2 cup chutney
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley (optional)

Combine bread crumbs, green onion, almonds, curry powder, salt,
and pepper.  Mix in the egg, then the ground chicken.  Mix well
with wet hands until the mixture is thoroughly blended.  Next you
need to shape it into meatballs, each "the size of a walnut".  I
find this easiest to do as follows.  Line an 8x8 pan with waxed
paper, leaving "ears" at each end for easy removal.  Spray with
Pam.

Pat the meat mixture evenly into the pan.  Place in the
freezer briefly.  When ready to proceed, heat oven to 375°F.
Prepare a greased rack in a shallow pan — keep in mind that these
will be small, tender meatballs.  Unless your rack has really small
openings, you will probably want to cover it with aluminum foil,
poking holes in the foil with a knife tip.  (And even if you do
have a rack with really small openings, you may want the foil
anyway, to prevent the meatballs from sticking.)  Use the "ears"
to remove the meat mixture from the pan to a cutting board.
Cut into 32 or 36 sections (4x8 or 6x6).  With wet hands, shape
each section into one meatball and place on the rack.  Bake 20
minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature with Creamy Chutney
Sauce.

To make sauce: place chutney and sour cream in a small blender
container.  Process (I use the "Mix" setting) until well chopped
and blended.  Stir in lemon juice and parsley.


Curried Chicken Salad
---------------------

Yield: about 16 servings

> This is a recipe that I cobbled together from a chicken dijon recipe
> and a couple of curried chicken salad recipes.  I frequently make it
> for end-of-show cast parties.  They're usually on Sundays, so I bake
> the chicken Saturday evening and use a couple of pieces hot for our
> dinner, then refrigerate the rest to turn into salad the next day. I
> use the "light" version of Miracle Whip, since that's what we keep on
> hand for sandwiches.  You could use the regular version, if that's
> what you have.  Actually, yogurt would probably work, too, but I
> haven't done that since some people don't want dairy with their meat.
> If your grapes are very large, you may want to cut them in fourths,
> rather than halves.

Chicken:
- 1/2 cup Miracle Whip Light
- 1 teaspoon finely curry powder
- 4 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, more or less

Salad:
- 1+1/2 cups Miracle Whip Light
- 2 teaspoons curry powder
- 1+1/4 cups halved seedless grapes
- 1+1/4 cups canned pineapple tidbits, drained
- water as needed
- toasted slivered almonds for garnish

Mix the 1/2 cup Miracle Whip Light with 1 teaspoon curry powder.
Place the chicken breasts in a greased baking dish (or two, if need
be).  For very large breasts, cut them in half to speed cooking.
Spread some curry mixture over the top of each breast.  Bake at
375°F for 20 to 30 minutes, until the chicken is done.
The exact time will depend on the thickness of the breasts.
(Cut into a piece to test it, making sure it's cooked through.)
Refrigerate until ready to make the salad, then dice the chicken.

Combine the remaining Miracle Whip Light and curry powder.
Add the diced chicken, grapes, and pineapple tidbits.  (This won't
be a whole 20-oz can of pineapple, but more seems like too much.)
I add a little bit of water, a tablespoon or so at a time, to make the
mixture less gluey.  Refrigerate.  Just before serving, garnish with
a few tablespoons of toasted slivered almonds.


Deluxe Baked Macaroni and Cheese
--------------------------------

Yield: 1.5-quart baking dish

> This recipe is based on one that used to be printed on the Kraft
> Deluxe Macaroni and Cheese box. I've added the squash, to make it
> less glue-like and a little  bit healthier. Also, the recipe
> called for mild shredded cheddar, but I use sharp, since that's
> what I keep on hand.

- 1 package (14 ounces) Kraft Deluxe Macaroni and Cheese Dinner
- 1 small-to-medium yellow squash, cut into small dice
- 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 1 cup milk

Topping:
- 1 cup bread crumbs (I normally use very small dice)
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted
- small slices of cheddar (or more shredded cheddar)

Prepare dinner as directed on package, except boil the squash
along with the macaroni. Stir in mozzarella, cheddar, and milk.
Place in a greased 1.5-quart baking dish.

For the topping: toss the bread crumbs with the melted butter
and sprinkle them on the casserole. Then garnish with small
slices of cheddar (such as thin slices from a Cracker Barrel stick)
or shredded cheddar.

Bake at 375 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes, until the topping is
as brown as you like.


Dunkable Brownies
-----------------

Yield:  about 6 dozen

> This recipe was really named "BAKER'S One Bowl Chocolate Brownie
> Cookies"  in the magazine ad it came from, and (of course) called
> specifically for BAKER'S chocolate and CALUMET baking powder.  I
> usually have unsweetened baking chocolate on hand, but not usually
> semi-sweet or bittersweet, so I usually substitute 6 ounces (1 cup)
> of semi-sweet chocolate bits.  You can easily toast nuts in the
> microwave — use high power and stir frequently; remember they
> may continue to darken after you take them out of the oven.

- 6 ounces semi-sweet or bittersweet baking chocolate
- 4 ounces unsweetened baking chocolate
- 6 tablespoons butter
- 1+1/4 cups sugar
- 3 eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla
- 1 cup flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups toasted chopped walnuts (optional)

Heat oven to 325 degrees.  Microwave chocolate and butter in a
large microwavable bowl on high for 1.5 to 2 minutes, or until
chocolate is almost melted, stirring halfway through heating time.
Stir until chocolate is completely melted and smooth.  Stir sugar
into chocolate until blended.  Mix in eggs and vanilla.  Stir in
flour, baking powder, and salt.  Stir in nuts.  Drop by rounded
teaspoonfuls, 1 inch apart, onto ungreased baking sheet.  Bake
12 minutes or until set.  *DO NOT OVERBAKE.*  Cool 5 minutes;
remove from cookie sheet.  Cool completely on wire racks.  Store
in an airtight container.


Frangipane Tart
---------------

Yield:  one 8-inch tart

> This recipe came from the 9/12/06 issue of Woman's Day magazine.
> It used plums as the filling; that's OK, but the almond paste
> overwhelms the plum flavor.  I think it would be better with
> peaches; other fruits might be good, too.  The original recipe
> just said to use an ungreased baking sheet, but it's a lot
> easier to "remove to a wire rack" if you line the sheet.  And,
> of course you could make your own pie crust, if you don't mind
> the extra effort.

- 1 roll (7 ounces) almond paste
- 1 refrigerated pie crust (the flat kind)
- 3 medium red or black plums (or other fruit)
- 2 tablespoons sugar

Heat oven to 450 degrees.  If using plums, cut each into eight
wedges.  (For peaches, peel and slice.)  Line a baking sheet
with parchment paper or aluminum foil.  Roll the almond paste
between two pieces of plastic wrap into an 8-inch circle.
Unroll the pie crust onto the baking sheet and center the
circle of almond paste on top of it.  Arrange the fruit on
top of that and sprinkle with sugar.  Fold the edges of the
pie crust up over the fruit, crimping dough to fit.  (This
won't cover much of the fruit, just an inch or two around
the edge.)  Bake 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to 375 degrees and
bake another 25 minutes, or until the crust is lightly browned
and the fruit is juicy and tender.  Remove to a wire rack to
cool.  Serve warm or at room temperature.


German's Sweet Chocolate Cake
-----------------------------

Yield: one 8-inch square layer

> This is half of the recipe from the German's chocolate box, with
> the baking instructions for the square layer taken from the Betty
> Crocker cookbook recipe.  I've cut the recipe in half because we
> are a small family, and I'm the only one who's really fond of
> this cake.  The recipe notes that "this delicate cake will have
> a flat slightly sugary top crust which tends to crack."  The
> filling and frosting recipe is the Betty Crocker version for a
> whole cake; that's about 2/3 of the chocolate box recipe.  Note
> that the box recipe doesn't grease the pan, although Betty
> Crocker does.

Cake:
- 2 ounces German's sweet baking chocolate
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 cup flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup butter, softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 2 egg whites

Coconut-Pecan Filling and Frosting:
- 1 cup evaporated milk
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup butter
- 3 egg yolks, slightly beaten
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1+1/3 cup coconut
- 1 cup chopped pecans

Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Line an 8" square pan with waxed
paper.  Microwave chocolate and water on HIGH for 1 minute, or
until chocolate is almost melted, stirring halfway through heating
time.  Stir until chocolate is completely melted.  Mix flour,
baking soda, and salt; set aside.  Beat the egg whites until stiff
peaks form; set aside.  Beat the butter and sugar in another bowl
until they are light and fluffy.  Add egg yolks, one at a time,
beating well after each addition.  Stir in chocolate mixture and
vanilla.  Add flour mixture alternately with buttermilk, beating
after each addition until smooth.  Gently stir the egg whites
into the batter.  Pour into the prepared pan.  Bake for 45 to 50
minutes or until the cake springs back when it is lightly
touched at the center.  Immediately run a spatula between the
cake and the sides of the pan.  Cool 15 minutes; remove from pan
and cool completely.  Split the layer.  Spread Coconut-Pecan Filling
and Frosting between the two halves and on top of the cake.

To make the frosting: Stir milk, sugar, butter, egg yolks, and
vanilla in a medium saucepan.  Stirring constantly, cook on
medium heat 12 minutes or until thickened and golden brown.
Remove from heat.  Stir in coconut and pecans.  Cool to room
temperature and spreading consistency.


Hamburger Stroganoff
--------------------

Yield: about 4 servings

> This is something my husband taught me to make, although he used
> canned mushrooms, and I think it's better with fresh ones. You
> can save time by buying pre-sliced mushrooms.  It's bad to boil
> sour cream, so it's added right before serving and heated only
> until it's heated through.

- 1 large onion (or 2 smaller onions)
- 1/2 head garlic
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 can condensed cream-of-chicken soup
- 8–12 ounces fresh mushrooms
- 1+1/2 cups sour cream

Saute the onion and garlic in a saucepan, meanwhile browning
the ground beef in a separate pan. (Or, you can brown the beef,
remove it, saute the onion/garlic, then recombine. Or the lazy
cooks can just add the onion/garlic to the pan once the beef is
partially browned.)  Combine the beef with the onions and
garlic, and add the undiluted soup.  Cover and simmer for about
20 minutes.  Meanwhile, sauté the mushrooms. Add the sautéed
mushrooms and simmer a while longer.

Shortly before serving, add the sour cream and stir well
until the sauce is heated through.

Meanwhile, cook flat noodles according to the package directions.
Serve the stroganoff over noodles.


Herbed Beef Stew
----------------

Yield: 8 to 10 servings

> This recipe has been adapted from a recipe submitted to either
> "Country" or "Taste of Home" magazine by Marlene Severson, of
> Everson, Washington.

- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons cooking oil
- 2 or 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (14.5 ounces) diced tomatoes, undrained
- 3 cups water
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 or 2 beef bouillon cubes
- 2 cups cubed peeled potatoes
- 2 cups sliced carrots
- 1/2 green pepper, chopped (optional)
- 1/4 pound mushrooms, sliced
- 8 to 16 ounces frozen cut green beans
- 8 to 16 ounces frozen peas
- 8 to 16 ounces frozen corn
- 1/2 cup flour (optional)


Heat oil in large pot.  Saute onions and meat until meat is brown.
Add garlic, tomatoes, water, and seasonings.  Cover and simmer for
90 minutes, or until meat is tender.  Stir in potatoes, carrots,
and green pepper; simmer 30 minutes.  Add remaining ingredients,
cover, and simmer 25 minutes or until done.  Shake the flour with
water to make a thin paste and stir into stew to thicken.


Iced Pumpkin Cookies
--------------------

Yield: 3 dozen

> This recipe was contributed to "Taste of Home" magazine by Johna

- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 cup canned pumpkin
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder

In a large bowl, cream butter and sugars until light and fluffy.
Beat in egg and pumpkin. Combine the flours,baking powder,salt,
baking soda, and spices; gradually add to creamed mixture and
mix well. Stir in the granola, walnuts, chips and cranberries.
Drop by tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart onto greased baking sheets.
Bake at 350°F for 15-18 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove
to wire racks to cool.

In a small bowl, combine icing ingredients until smooth.
Spread over cooled cookies. Store in the refrigerator.


Italian Vegetable Soup
----------------------

Yield: 8 to 12 servings

> This recipe probably came from "Country" magazine (an ancestor of
> "Taste of Home").  It was contributed by Bonnie Vawter, of Alton,
> Missouri.  It is fairly quick to make, and although it is a "from
> scratch" recipe, it does involve opening a lot of cans.  Don't get
> too hung up on the exact size of the cans — manufacturers seem to
> change the sizes over the years.

- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 cup diced onion
- 1 cup sliced celery
- 1 cup sliced carrots
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (16 ounces) tomatoes
- 1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce
- 1 can (15 ounces) red kidney beans, undrained
- 2 cups water
- 5 teaspoons beef bouillion granules or 5 beef bouillion cubes
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley flakes
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon sweet basil
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 cups shredded cabbage
- 1 cup frozen or fresh green beans, cut in 1-inch pieces
- 1/2 cup small elbow macaroni
- Parmesan cheese (optional)

Brown beef in large heavy kettle; drain.  Add all the ingredients
*except* cabbage, green beans, and macaroni.  Bring to boil.  Lower
heat; cover and simmer 20 minutes.  Add cabbage, green beans, and
macaroni; bring to boil and simmer until vegetables are tender.  If
you prefer a thinner soup, add additional water or broth.  Sprinkle
with the Parmesan cheese before serving, if desired.

Diabetic Exchanges:  One serving equals 1 protein, 1 bread; also
152 calories, 776 mg sodium, 34 mg cholesterol, 17 gm carbohydrate,
12 gm protein, 4 gm fat.  (Figured at the optimistic 12 servings)

Notes:  I always omit the celery, because Tony doesn't like it, and
I cut back the oregano a bit, too.  For the can of tomatoes, I use
Del Monte Fresh Cut Diced Tomatoes, which actually come in a 14.5
ounce can.  If you use whole tomatoes, you will want to break them
up before putting them in — putting them in a bowl and using a
potato masher is a fast way to do it.

Sometimes, I substitute a 19-ounce can of Cannellini (white kidney
beans) for the red kidney beans.  Also, if I don't have any plain
tomato sauce, I use a 15-ounce can of Hunt's Ready Original Italian
Style tomato sauce, and omit the oregano and basil.


Korean Beef Patties
-------------------

Yield: 4 servings

> This recipe came from one of the Reiman publications.  It was
> contributed by Marsha Ransom, of South Haven, Michigan.  I like
> it very much; the rest of the family is not so keen on it.  The
> flavor is very similar to bulgogi.

- 1 pound ground beef
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
- 1 tablespoon Oriental sesame oil
- 2+1/2 tablespoons chopped green onion
- 1 tablespoon garlic, minced
- black pepper to taste

Combine all ingredients.  Form into four balls and flatten into
patties.  Broil, grill, or pan-fry until done.


Macadamia Shortbread
--------------------

Yield: 2 to 3 dozen

> This recipe is from a "Family Circle" cookie collection booklet.
> These are among my favorite cookies.  My husband complains that
> they are "a waste of good macadamias", but that doesn't stop him
> from eating them.  I never use the optional garnishes.  Although
> the recipe specifies unsalted butter, you can use salted butter if
> that's all you have on hand.  The flavor is a bit more delicate
> with the unsalted butter.

- 1 cup flour
- 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
- 1/4 cup corn starch
- 1 cup macadamia nuts, finely chopped
- 3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- macadamia nut halves for garnish (optional)
- rock sugar, for garnish (optional)

Beat butter at low speed until creamy.  Stir together the flour,
confectioners' sugar, corn starch, and nuts, then beat them into
the mixture.  Using a level tablespoon, shape dough into balls.
Place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets.  Flatten each
ball with a fork.  Press a macadamia half into each cookie, if
desired.  Bake in a 300 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until
just lightly browned around the edge.  Cool on baking sheet for
5 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool.  Sprinkle with rock
sugar, if desired.


Orange Kiss-Me Cake
-------------------

Yield: 13x9-inch cake

> This recipe is from a magazine clipping which attributes it to
> the "Pillsbury Best of the Bake-off Cookbook".  It's fun to make;
> it actually uses an entire orange (no doubt including all sorts
> of healthy flavenoids).  We're usually given a box of oranges and
> grapefruit for Christmas, and this is a good way to use one of the
> oranges.  The sugar-nut topping is just a bit messy, so this is
> best in a plate-and-fork situation.


 Cake:
- 1 orange
- 1 cup raisins
- 1/3 cup walnuts
- 2 cups flour
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1/2 cup butter, softened
- 2 eggs

Topping:
- 1/3 cup orange juice (reserved)
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts

Squeeze the orange, reserving 1/3 cup orange juice for the topping.
(You may need to add some extra orange juice to get 1/3 cup.)
Remove the seeds from the orange.  Grind together the orange,
raisins and 1/3 cup walnuts in a food processor, blender or food
mill.  Combine the flour and remaining cake ingredients in a
large bowl, mix at low speed until moistened, then at medium
speed for 3 minutes.  Add the orange-raisin-nut mixture.  Pour
the batter into a greased and floured 13x9-inch pan.  Bake at
350°F for 35 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick
inserted in the center comes out clean.  Drizzle the reserved
orange juice over the warm cake in the pan.  Combine the 1/3 cup
sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl, stir in the 1/4 cup walnuts,
and sprinkle the mixture over the cake.  Cool completely.


Pork Fried Rice
---------------

Yield: 4 servings

> This recipe is from a magazine clipping; probably either "Family
> Circle" or "Woman's Day".  It's one of my more variable recipes;
> what I use depends a lot on what's on hand.  I usually use a mix of
> white rice and quick-cooking brown rice — the white rice improves
> the texture, and the brown rice improves the flavor.  Also, I don't
> think I've ever made this with uncooked pork; instead I use
> leftover pork roast.  I may use an ordinary onion in place of the
> green onion, canned pimiento in place of red pepper, and/or powdered
> ginger in place of the chopped fresh ginger.  Sometimes, I even add
> some chopped dried apricot or currants, just to liven it up.

- 3/4 pound trimmed boneless pork loin
- 1 cup quick-cooking brown rice
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3 cups sliced cabbage
- 1 sweet red pepper, chopped
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger
- 1 bunch green onions, trimmed and sliced
- 1 cup frozen peas
- 1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons Oriental sesame oil

Slice pork into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Cut slices into 3/4-inch
strips.  Cook rice according to package directions.  Heat oil in
12-inch skillet over medium heat.  If using regular onion, start by
sauteing it until translucent.  Add cabbage, red pepper, and water.
Cook, covered, 8 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in pork and
ginger; cover and cook 3 to 5 minutes or until pork is no longer
pink in center.  (For precooked pork, just cook until heated
through.) Stir in rice, green onion, and peas.  (The recipe claims
that you can do this much up to 2 days ahead, and keep refrigerated
until ready to proceed.) Stir soy sauce and sesame oil into rice
mixture; cook 2 minutes.  (If reheating, heat sesame oil in skillet,
then add rice mixture and soy sauce; cook 3 to 5 minutes.)

Exchanges: 1+1/2 starch/bread, 2+1/2 vegetable, 2+1/2 lean meat, 1 fat.


Puffy Cheese Bake
-----------------

Yield: 4 servings

> This is a long-time family favorite.  The original recipe is
> from "Betty Crocker's Cookbook", but I have made some changes.
> The servings are a bit on the small side for my family —
> there's not likely to be any left over from the three of us.
> The recipe specified "process American cheese", but I
> usually use sharp cheddar, since that's what we have on hand.
> I usually use somewhat less than a 1/8 teaspoonful of curry
> powder.

- 6–8 slices bread, buttered
- 1+1/2 cups shredded cheese (about 6 ounces)
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
- 1/4 teaspoon paprika
- dash curry powder (original says cayenne pepper)
- 1 cup milk (original says light cream)

Cut each slice of bread into four triangles.  Use them to line
the bottom and sides of an 8-inch square baking dish, butter
side down.  (I usually use heels for the bottom, if I have any,
and non-heels for the sides.)  Sprinkle the cheese evenly over
bread on the bottom of the pan.  Put the eggs and seasonings in
a small bowl and beat slightly, then add the milk (and melted
butter, if using) and mix thoroughly.  Pour into the baking
dish.  Bake uncovered at 350°F for 30 to 40 minutes, until
nicely browned.


Rabbi Dreyfus's Beef Brisket
----------------------------

Yield: about 8 servings

> This recipe came from the 12/22/87 issue of "Woman's Day" magazine.
> It was part of a feature about how female ministers and rabbis
> manage their holiday meals, given their religious responsibilities.
> "This is about as easy as anything can be," says Rabbi Dreyfus.  The
> recipe was handed down by her mother, Eve.  You can cook, slice, and
> refrigerate the beef the day before, then just reheat when you're
> ready.  The original recipe included a microwave variant; but the
> best part of this meal is the slowly browned onions, and they don't
> brown in the microwave, so I haven't bothered with copying those
> directions.

- 3 large onions, halved and sliced thin (3 cups)
- 4-pound beef brisket, thin cut, top fat trimmed to 1/4 inch
- 1 large clove garlic, cut in half
- 2 teaspoons paprika (I just use "Season-All" instead of these)
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper (I just use "Season-All" instead of these)
- 1+1/2 cups beef broth

Heat oven to 350°F.  Make a bed of onions in the roasting
pan.  Rub brisket with garlic and add garlic to onions.  Sprinkle
brisket with paprika and pepper.  (I usually just sprinkle with
"Season-All", instead.) Put brisket fat side up on onions.  Add
broth to pan; cover with foil.  Bake 150 minutes or until "almost
tender" when pierced with a fork.  Remove foil, bake 30 minutes or
until meat is tender and top is golden brown.  To serve, remove meat
to serving platter or cutting board.  Cover loosely with foil; let
stand 10 minutes.  (At this point, I usually pour the juices off of
the onions, and return the onions to the oven, to finish browning.)
With sharp knife, cut in thin slices across the grain.  Skim fat
from pan juices.  Serve onions and juices with meat.  To save:
return sliced meat to pan with juices and onions; cover and
refrigerate.  When ready to serve, reheat at 350°F for 30 to 35
minutes, until hot.


Roasted Carrot Dip
------------------

Yield: 8 to 10 servings

> This recipe was contributed to the August/September 2005 issue
> of "Taste of Home" by Alana Rowley of Calgary, Alberta.  It is
> a tasty dip, and the carrots give it some redeeming nutritional
> value.  Crisp pita wedges are particularly recommended as the
> "dippers".

> Notes/Substitutions:  I doubt that the type of oil makes much
> difference; if you don't have olive oil, try some other type.
> I don't stock white wine vinegar, so I use apple cider vinegar
> instead.  Similarly, I use "Miracle Whip" salad dressing in
> place of the mayonnaise.  And you can use an ordinary 13-inch
> x 9-inch dish to roast the carrots — reduce the heat to
> 400 degrees if using glass rather than metal.  Also, in most
> recipes you can substitute plain yogurt for sour cream, but
> I haven't tried that with this one.  I find it hard to
> believe that such tiny amounts of seasoning can make much
> difference in the result, but there they are.  The curry
> powder isn't in the original, but I like curry.

- 10 medium carrots, peeled
- 5 garlic cloves, peeled
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 6 to 8 tablespoons water (or more)
- 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar (or other vinegar)
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise (or mayonnaise-style salad dressing)
- 1/4 cup sour cream
- 1/8 teaspoon sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon pepper
- curry powder (just a few grains — optional)

Cut carrots in half widthwise, then cut lengthwise into half-
inch thick slices.  In a bowl, combine the carrots, garlic, and
oil; toss to coat.  Transfer to a greased 15-inch x 10-inch x
1-inch baking pan.  Bake, uncovered at 425 degrees for 20
minutes.  Stir, and bake 15 to 20 minutes longer or until
carrots are tender.  Cool slightly.  In a food processor,
combine 6 tablespoons of the water, vinegar, mayonnaise, sour
cream, seasonings, and the carrot mixture and process until
smooth, adding additional water if needed to achieve desired
consistency.  (The original recipe specified using a blender;
maybe mine is just old, but it doesn't do very well with this
mixture.  I had to add a fair amount of extra water to appease
it.)  Transfer the dip to a bowl and refrigerate until serving.


Sauerkraut Casserole
--------------------

Yield: 6 to 8 servings

> This recipe came from either "Country" or "Taste of Home" magazine.
> It was contributed by Rosemary Pryor, of Pasadena, Maryland.  It's
> one of my standard Thanksgiving recipes.  I usually reduce the
> caraway seed to about a half-teaspoon, since my family is not
> particularly fond of it; and decrease the brown sugar to about 1/3
> cup, because otherwise my husband thinks it is too sweet.  Also, I
> generally cut back the onion a little, since we already have quite a
> bit of onion in our usual Thanksgiving stuffing.

- 1 pound mild Italian sausage links, cut into 1-inch slices
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 apples, peeled and quartered
- 1 can (27 ounces) sauerkraut, undrained
- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons caraway seed
- Snipped parsley (for garnish), optional

In a skillet, cook sausage and onion until sausage is brown and
onion is tender; drain.  Stir in apples, sauerkraut, water, brown
sugar and caraway seed.  Transfer to a 2.5-quart baking dish.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees for one hour.  Garnish with parsley,
if desired.

Note:  I usually cook this on top of the stove for a couple of
hours, rather than in the oven.  So I start out cooking the sausage
and onion in a 3-quart saucepan, drain it, then add the rest and
simmer until we're ready to eat.


Shrimp Toast
------------

Yield: 12 slices (3 or 4 servings)

> Sam and Arthur modified this recipe from one found online.
> The online recipe suggested frying bread-side-down, never
> flipping, and for something like 4 minutes per side; but
> that's a recipe for burnt bread and cold shrimp paste.
> We're trying to simulate deep-frying here, as you would for
> fried squash or okra or donuts.

- 6 oz. cooked peeled shrimp
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 large egg
- 3 slices bread
- Sesame seeds
- Canola oil for frying

Blend the shrimp, soy sauce, garlic, sesame oil, and egg in a
food processor until they form a paste. Spread the shrimp paste
on the bread; cover densely with sesame seeds. Cut off the
crusts and cut the bread into triangles.

Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a frying pan or wok. Fry the toasts
bread side down for 30 seconds or until golden (you'll be able
to see them browning on the edges); then flip and fry
sesame-seed side down for 1 minute or until golden on both sides.

Serve with sweet and sour sauce or chutney.


Simple Stollen
--------------

Yield: 1 loaf

> This is another "Taste of Home" recipe, contributed by Shirley
> Glaab, of Hattiesburg, Mississippi.  It is made with baking
> powder, rather than yeast, so it is relatively quick to make.
> You can use two eggs, rather than an egg and an egg yolk, if
> you don't have a use for the leftover eggwhite; the texture
> of the stollen will be just a bit firmer if you do.

- 2+1/4 cups flour
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1+1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 6 tablespoons cold butter
- 1 cup ricotta cheese
- 1/2 cup chopped mixed candied fruit
- 1/2 cup raisins
- 1/3 cup slivered almonds, toasted
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
- 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel
- 1 egg
- 1 egg yolk
- butter to rub or brush over cooked stollen

In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and
salt.  Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles fine
crumbs.  Stir in the ricotta, candied fruit, raisins, almonds,
extracts, lemon peel, egg, and yolk just until mixed.  (This
is a fairly dry mixture, so this may take a little doing.)
Turn onto a floured surface.  Knead "five times".  (What
you really do is to work it with your hands to finish the
incorporation of the dry ingredients, then knead.)  Roll
or pat out into a 10-inch by 8-inch oval.  Fold a long side
over to within one inch of the opposite side.  Press edge
lightly to seal.  Place on a greased baking sheet, curving
ends slightly to form a shallow crescent.  Bake at 350 degrees
Fahrenheit for 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown.  While
the loaf is still hot, brush it with about a tablespoonful
of melted butter, or rub it well with the end of stick of
butter.  (This will make the stollen easier to slice neatly
later on.)  Remove to a wire rack to cool completely.  Dust
with confectioners' sugar when cool.


Special Shrimp Bake
-------------------

Yield: 8 to 10 servings

> This recipe came from one of the Reiman publications, probably
> "Taste of Home".  It was submitted by Kathy Houchen, of Waldorf,
> Maryland.  I would describe this as a creamy Spanish rice with
> shrimp and almonds.  Ms.  Houchen suggests that it can be put
> together the night before, and baked the following day.  If you're
> starting out with raw, unpeeled shrimp, you may want to do that
> anyway, just because it takes so long to peel 2.5 pounds of medium
> shrimp.  I recommend starting out by buying shrimp that has already
> been cooked, peeled, and deveined — you will probably still have to
> remove the tails yourself, and touch up the deveining, but it will
> save a lot of time.  Don't forget you have to cook the rice and
> toast the almonds before you can put the casserole together, too.

Shrimp:
- 1 pound cooked, peeled, and deveined medium shrimp, OR
- 2.5 pounds uncooked medium shrimp in the shell
- 3 quarts water
- 1 tablespoon salt

Casserole:
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1/4 cup finely chopped green pepper
- 1/4 cup finely chopped onion
- 2 tablespoons butter or margarine
- 1 can (10-3/4 ounces) condensed tomato soup, undiluted
- 1 cup whipping cream
- 2+1/4 cups cooked rice
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon mace
- 1/8 teaspoon pepper
- 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/2 cup slivered almonds, toasted

Prepare the shrimp: if starting with raw shrimp, you can peel them
before or after cooking, whichever you prefer.  Most cookbook
authors think the flavor is better if cooked in the shell.  At any
rate, to cook them, bring the water and salt to a boil, add the
shrimp, and cook for 3 minutes, or until pink.  Drain.

Once the shrimp have been cooked, peeled, and deveined, sprinkle
them with the oil and lemon juice, and set aside.

In a large skillet, saute the green pepper and onion in butter
for 5 minutes, or until tender.  Add soup, cream, rice, and
seasonings.  Reserve 1 cup of shrimp and 1/4 cup of almonds for
the garnish.  Add the rest of the shrimp and almonds to the
rice mixture.  Transfer to a greased 2-quart baking dish.  Bake
uncovered at 350°F. for 30 to 35 minutes.  Top with
remaining shrimp and almonds, bake 20 minutes longer.


Split Pea Soup
--------------

Yield:  4 to 6 servings

> This recipe is from the label of the "Jack Rabbit" brand of split
> peas.  I have noticed that in my supermarket, the split peas sold
> in the Hispanic foods section are cheaper than the split peas
> sold in the regular bean section, for no obvious reason.  We
> don't often have a ham shank available, but we like split pea soup,
> so I frequently substitute a small ham steak (slice) in a single
> recipe, or a large one in a double recipe.  The original recipe
> didn't call for pureeing, but we prefer it that way.

- 1 pound split peas
- 3 quarts water
- 1 small ham shank
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 chicken bouillon cubes
- 1 garlic clove, chopped (or 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder)
- 1/2 teaspoon oregano leaves
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1/8 teaspoon curry powder (optional)
- 1 bay leaf
- 1+1/2 cups thinly sliced carrots
- 1 cup chopped celery

Sort and rinse split peas.  In a large, deep pot, combine peas,
water, ham shank, onion, bouillon cubes, and seasonings.  Simmer,
uncovered, for 90 minutes.  Remove ham shank, trim meat off bone,
and return meat to pot.  (At this point, I save out the ham that I
don't want to puree, to be added back in later.) Stir in carrots and
celery.  Simmer, uncovered, an additional 2 to 2+1/2 hours, or until
soup reaches desired thickness.  Remove and discard the bay leaf.
Using a blender, puree the soup in batches and return it to the pot
(actually, I use a second pot).  Chop the reserved ham, add it to
the pot, and heat through.  You may want to add a bit of hot sauce,
Worcestershire sauce, and/or molasses, depending on your taste.
My husband likes to have a dollop of sour cream on top of his bowl
of soup.


Steak and Onion Pie
-------------------

Yield: 4 to 6 servings

> This recipe came from "Country Extra" magazine, and was contributed
> by Ardis Wirtz, of Newburgh, Indiana.  It claimed "6 to 8 servings",
> but in our household "4 to 6" is more accurate.  I usually use
> Pillsbury's ready-to-use pie crust on it, although the shape isn't
> quite right for my dish.  A non-stick pot would be good for this
> recipe — it seems that no matter how often I "stir occasionally", I
> always wind up with a cooked-on mess on the bottom of my pot.

- 1 large onion, sliced
- 1/3 cup shortening or oil
- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1+1/2 teaspoons ground allspice
- 1+1/2 pounds boneless round steak, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 cups boiling water
- 1+1/2 cups diced peeled potatoes
- 1 cup diced carrots
- 1 cup frozen peas
- pie pastry (9 to 10 inches)

In a Dutch oven, lightly brown onion in shortening or oil.
Meanwhile, combine flour, salt, pepper, ginger and allspice in a
plastic bag.  Place meat cubes in the bag, a few at a time, and
shake well to coat.  Add meat to pot and brown on all sides.
Add water, cover, and simmer for 1 hour or until meat is tender,
stirring occasionally.  Add potatoes and carrots, cover, and cook
for 15 minutes.  Stir in peas and continue cooking until all
vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.  Spoon meat mixture into
a 9-inch square baking pan.  Roll pastry out into a 10-inch square,
place over meat mixture, and seal edges to pan.  Cut several small
steam vents in crust.  Bake at 375 degrees for 25–30 minutes, or
until pastry is browned.


Strawberry Soup
---------------

Yield: 4 servings

> This recipe is from an article on school lunches in the 9/1/93 issue
> of Woman's Day magazine.  I've never tried the maple syrup variant,
> since my family isn't particularly fond of maple flavor.  I usually
> add some extra milk, and we drink the soup from mugs rather than
> spooning it from a small bowl.  I've streamlined the instructions
> somewhat.  You do need to let the strawberries thaw most of the way,
> to keep your blender happy; but if you make the soup before they're
> completely thawed, you can serve it immediately, instead of needing
> to refrigerate it for 2 hours.  I sometimes substitute vanilla
> yogurt for plain, and reduce the sugar a little.

- 1 bag (20 ounces) unsweetened frozen strawberries, thawed
- 1/2 cup low-fat milk
- 1/2 cup plain low-fat yogurt
- 1/4 cup maple syrup or granulated sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract

Place all ingredients in blender and process.  Pour into serving
bowl.  Cover and chill at least 2 hours before serving.

Streusel-Topped Pumpkin Pie
---------------------------

Yield: 1 pie

> This is a recipe that I clipped from Woman's Day magazine years
> ago and which my family enjoys every Thanksgiving.  The editors
> recommended cutting it into 12 servings, since it is "especially
> rich".  You might get away with that, but I think in real life
> it's more likely to be 8 servings.

- One frozen pumpkin custard bake-and-serve pie (46 ounces)
- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/3 cup cold butter or margarine, cut in small pieces
- 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped coarse

Bake the pie according to the package directions until the center
is partially set — 10 to 15 minutes less than the total baking
time.  Meanwhile, mix flour, sugar, and cinnamon in a medium-sized
bowl.  Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles very coarse
crumbs.  Stir in the chopped walnuts.  Sprinkle the streusel over
the partially-baked pie, then bake 10 to 15 minutes longer, until
a knife inserted in the center comes out clean and the topping is
bubbly and lightly browned.  Let pie cool for at least 2 hours.


Stuffing
--------

Yield: 4 servings

> I use "Stove Top Stuffing", but I modify the instructions and add
> some additional ingredients.  For Thanksgiving dinner, I would
> user 2 or 3 boxes of stuffing, and either bake some of the
> stuffing in the turkey or pour the turkey juices over the stuffing
> before serving.  In recent years, I've taken to adding some
> yellow squash; it doesn't affect the flavor but makes the
> stuffing lighter in texture (and calories).

- 1 box "Stove Top Stuffing"
- butter and water, as directed on box
- 1/8 cup minced onion
- 1 tablespoon sliced almonds (optional)
- 1/4 cup chopped dried apricots
- 1 small yellow squash, in small dice (optional)
- 1 thick slice or 2 thin slices bread, toasted and cubed

The instructions on the box used to call for boiling the butter
and water, then adding a seasoning mix and simmering 5 minutes
before adding the bread cubes.  Recently, they've been putting
the seasoning directly on the bread cubes and omit the simmering.
Instead, I start out by melting the butter in the pan and slowly
cooking the onion in it until it starts to color.  If I'm using
sliced almonds, I add them when the onions are almost done.
Meanwhile, I put the chopped apricots in the water.  Once the
onion is done, add the water, apricots, squash, and seasoning
mix (if any).  Simmer 5 minutes.  Add the extra toast cubes along
with the package of bread from the mix, and let sit, covered,
off the heat for 5 minutes, then serve.


Sweet Potato Fritters
---------------------

Yield: 8 fritters

> From Alanna Figueira on paleo food blog "Planks Love & Guacamole".

- 2 sweet potatoes, shredded (use a cheese grater)
- 1/2 cup green onions (6 to 8 onions)
- 4 eggs
- 5 tablespoons coconut flour
- 3 tablespoons tapioca starch
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 cup bacon fat for frying

Peel and shred the sweet potato. In a large bowl, lightly beat
the eggs; then add the shredded sweet potato and the chopped
green onions. Lightly mix.

In a small bowl, mix the flour, starch, salt, pepper, and onion
powder. Add them to the large bowl and mix thoroughly.
Preheat a frying pan on medium heat; add the bacon fat to the pan.
Form balls of the fritter batter, flatten them and drop them in
the pan. Fry for three or four minutes per side, until browned
and crispy. Finish with salt. Serve hot.


Thanksgiving Dinner Menu
------------------------

> This is a typical Thanksgiving menu in our family.  My mother
> would have served stuffed pork chops, rather than turkey, since my
> younger sister had trouble tolerating turkey.  And she would have
> made the gravy, rolls, and pies from scratch.  My mother also
> would serve the meal at midday.  But, my sister-in-law usually
> travels down from Otego, New York to spend the long weekend with
> us, and the Smithsonian museums in Washington, DC are open on
> Thanksgiving, and not crowded that day, although they are crowded
> the rest of the weekend.  So, our usual plan is that the rest of
> the family goes off to Washington for the day, while I stay home
> and fix the dinner in a leisurely manner, and we eat the dinner
> when they get back, around dark.  We usually take a pause
> for digestion between the main dinner and the dessert.  Recipes
> for the starred items are included in this cookbook.

- Grape Juice mixed with Ginger Ale
- Roast Turkey (cooked in an oven bag)
- Stuffing*
- Cranberry Sauce (from a can)
- Gravy (usually Heinz gravy, from a jar)
- Rolls
- Mashed Potatoes
- Carrot Casserole*
- Sauerkraut Casserole*
- Streusel-Topped Pumpkin Pie*
- Milk


Toffee Chip Cookies
-------------------

Yield: about 10 dozen

> This recipe was contributed to "Taste of Home" magazine by Frances
> Ronnankamp of Albion, Nebraska.  It is definitely a "kitchen sink"
> style cookie, with oats and nuts and coconut and toffee chips, but
> the Rice Krispies do lighten it a bit.  This makes a lot of very
> tasty cookies with no chocolate mess.  I sent a batch to the shore
> with my son and his friends for their senior "Beach Week".

- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 eggs
- 2+1/2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon cream of tartar
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 cups crisp rice cereal
- 1 cup quick-cooking oats
- 1 cup flaked coconut
- 1 cup chopped peacns
- 1 cup English toffee bits or almond brickle bits

In a large mixing bowl, cream butter, oil, sugars, and vanilla.
Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  In
a separate bowl, combine the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda,
and salt; then add it to the creamed mixture.  Stir in the
remaining ingredients.  Drop by tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart
onto ungreased baking sheets.  Bake at 350 degrees for 10 to 12
minutes or until lightly browned.  Remove to wire racks to cool.


Winter Fruit Compote
--------------------

Yield: 10 half-cup servings

> This recipe came from the 1/6/98 issue of "Woman's Day" magazine.
> I usually make it to help use up our Christmas gift box of oranges
> and grapefruit; my husband is very fond of it.  The recipe suggests
> serving it on rice pudding, pancakes, oatmeal, or with roast
> chicken or broiled pork chops.  We usually just eat it as a side
> dish with breakfast or dinner.

- 1 cup dried pitted prunes, cut in half
- 1 cup dried apricots, cut in half
- 1/2 cup golden raisins
- 1+1/2 cups orange juice
- 2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar
- 2 pink grapefruit
- 3 navel oranges

In a 2-quart saucepan, bring the prunes, apricots, raisins,
orange juice, and sugar to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and
simmer 4 to 5 minutes until the fruit is tender.  Pour into
a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until cold.

Cut the peel and white membrane from the grapefruit and oranges.
Holding the fruit over the bowl with the dried fruit mixture,
cut between membranes to release sections into the bowl, then
squeeze the juice from the membranes into the bowl.  Stir
gently to mix.
