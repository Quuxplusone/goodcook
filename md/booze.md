Boulevardier
------------

- 1 part sweet vermouth (Noilly Prat)
- 1 part bourbon (Bulleit) or brandy (Presidente)
- 1 part Campari

Build over ice in a lowball glass.
Alternatively, stir vigorously with ice and strain into a martini glass.
Garnish with a cherry.


Dry Martini
-----------

- 1 part dry vermouth (Martini & Rossi)
- 4 parts vodka

Stir with ice; strain carefully; garnish with two pimento olives.


Godfather
---------

> According to the IBA, a real "Godfather" contains Scotch whiskey,
> not bourbon; but Wikipedia blesses bourbon as a common variant.
> Sometimes I'll use Presidente brandy instead of bourbon, but that
> really makes it too sweet.
>
> The secret ingredient is Walcher amaretto, 28% ABV,
> with notes of vanilla and cherry.

- 2 parts bourbon (Bulleit)
- 1 part amaretto (Walcher) or crème de noyaux
- dash anisette (absinthe, ouzo, or sambuca, for example)

Build over a large cube of ice in a lowball glass. Stir vigorously
to melt the ice; it's better with a little icemelt in it.


Guinness Black Magic
--------------------

> This St Patrick's Day recipe comes from Lucy Parissi at
> https://www.supergoldenbakes.com/guinness-black-magic-cocktail/ (2016).
> The original calls for muddled blackberries and simple syrup,
> which seems like Chambord with extra steps.
> If you replace "parts" with "ounces" below, you'll have two
> small but refreshing servings. One can of Guinness contains
> 14.9 ounces.

- 4 parts bourbon (Bulleit)
- 3/4 part creme de cassis (Gabriel Boudier)
- 1 part fresh lime juice
- 8 parts Guinness stout

Shake the non-beer ingredients with ice; pour over ice in a
lowball glass; add the Guinness and stir gently.


Margarita
---------

- 2 parts tequila (Hornitos Añejo)
- 1 part fresh lime juice
- 1 part Cointreau
- 1 part triple sec

Shake with ice and serve up; or build over ice in a lowball glass.

Replace 1 part triple sec with 1 part Cointreau for a simpler recipe.
Replace 1 part triple sec with 1/2 part Licor 43 for a more complex
flavor profile.


Orange Bloom
------------

> This comes from "The Bartender's Standard Manual" by Fred Powell (1979).
> Its instructions are, "Stir with ice and strain. Serve with a cherry."

- 2 parts gin
- 1 part sweet vermouth (Noilly Prat)
- 1 part Cointreau
- water (optional)

Stir with ice; serve neat in a martini glass.


Sam Beauregarde
---------------

> Arthur made this one up.
> Boulaine's 30-proof coffee liqueur is slightly sweeter
> than Kahlua. Its purpose in this cocktail is to add sweetness.

- 2 parts gin (Gordon's)
- 1 part crème de violette (Crème Yvette)
- 1 dash coffee liqueur (Boulaine)
- 1 dash (10 drops) orange bitters
- absinthe rinse

Rinse a champagne flute with absinthe.
Stir the gin, crème de violette, and coffee liqueur with ice;
strain into the flute, add the orange bitters, and serve neat.
Garnish with a twist of orange or lemon.


The Unknown
-----------

> I think this one's original name was an adjective beginning with "C",
> but not "Cosmopolitan", of course. The Drambuie may have been
> a substitution for something more obscure but equally herbal.
> Being a mixture of three sweet liqueurs, this drink is
> extremely sweet and strong.

- 1 part absinthe
- 1 part Drambuie
- 1 part Grand Marnier

Stir vigorously with ice; serve neat in a martini glass.


Vieux Carré
-----------

> I originally found this recipe under the name "Sazerac," but it is
> definitely a Vieux Carré. (A Sazerac is an Old-Fashioned with an
> absinthe rinse; a Vieux Carré is a Manhattan with Benedictine.)
> Some modern recipes use only one base spirit (either cognac or
> bourbon). It is essential to use both.
> The traditional garnish is an orange twist; in this
> home-remedy version, we substitute a dash of orange liqueur.
> Nobody will notice if you omit the absinthe.

- 2 parts brandy (Presidente)
- 2 parts bourbon (Bulleit)
- 2 parts sweet vermouth (Noilly Prat)
- 1 part Benedictine
- two dashes Peychaud's bitters
- dash Cointreau or Grand Marnier
- a few drops of absinthe
- water (optional)

Rinse a lowball glass with absinthe. Add a large cube of ice;
build the remaining ingredients in the glass and stir.

Alternatively, mix mass quantities in an empty cocktail shaker
and pour over ice cubes.


Vieux Carré Martini
-------------------

> This is a Vieux Carré modified for the carb-conscious.
> Of course if you're carb-conscious you might omit the cherry.

- 1 part brandy (Presidente)
- 1 part bourbon (Bulleit)
- 1 part dry vermouth (Martini & Rossi)
- 1 dash Benedictine
- 1 dash orange blossom water
- 2 dashes Peychaud's bitters
