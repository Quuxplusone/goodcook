Dry Martini

- 2 parts gin
- 1 part sweet vermouth (Noilly Prat)
- 1 part Cointreau
- water (optional)

Shake with ice; serve neat in a martini glass.


Sazerac
-------

> Many modern recipes for a "Sazerac" use only one base spirit
> (either cognac or bourbon). It is essential to use both.
> The traditional garnish is an orange twist; in this
> home-remedy version, we substitute a dash of orange liqueur.
> Nobody will notice if you omit the absinthe.

- 2 parts brandy (Presidente)
- 2 parts bourbon (Bulleit)
- 2 parts sweet vermouth (Noilly Prat)
- 1 part Benedictine
- two dashes Peychaud's bitters
- dash Cointreau or Grand Marnier
- a few drops of absinthe
- water (optional)

Rinse a lowball glass with absinthe. Add a large cube of ice;
build the remaining ingredients in the glass.

Alternatively, mix mass quantities in an empty cocktail shaker
and pour over ice cubes.


The Unknown
-----------

> I think this one's original name was an adjective beginning with "C",
> but not "Cosmopolitan", of course. The Drambuie may have been
> a substitution for something more obscure but equally herbal.
> Being a mixture of three sweet liqueurs, this drink is
> extremely sweet and strong.

- 1 part absinthe
- 1 part Drambuie
