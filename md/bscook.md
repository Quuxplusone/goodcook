
Apple Raisin Bread
------------------

Yield: 3 loaves

         This recipe is from the "Taste of Home" magazine.  It was
         contributed by Perlene Hoekema of Lynden, Washington.  She forgot
         to mention when to add the salt, so I've added that part.  Also,
         she specified "all-purpose" flour, but I use "bread" flour if I
         have it on hand.  I've expanded on the directions for the hard
         step:  adding the apples and raisins.


             2 packages active dry yeast
         1-1/2 cups warm water, divided
             1 teaspoon sugar
             3 eggs, beaten
             1 cup applesauce
             1/2 cup honey
             1/2 cup vegetable oil
             2 teaspoons salt.
             8 to 9 cups flour
         1-1/2 cups diced peeled apples
             2 tablespoons lemon juice
         1-1/2 cups raisins
             2 tablespoons cornmeal
         GLAZE:
             1 egg, beaten
             Sugar


         In a small bowl, combine yeast, 1/2 cup water, and sugar; set
         aside.  In a (very) large bowl, combine eggs, applesauce, honey,
         oil, salt, and remaining water; mix well.  Stir in yeast mixture.
         Gradually add enough flour to form a soft dough.  Knead on a
         floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.  Place
         dough in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and
         let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.  Punch down
         and turn over in bowl.  Cover and let rise 30 minutes.

         Next, the recipe calls for combining the apples, raisins, and
         lemon juice in a small bowl.  I find it easier to use 3 small
         bowls, with 2 teaspoons of lemon juice, 1/2 cup of apples, and 1/2
         cup of raisins in each.  That way I'm sure of getting an equal
         distribution among the loaves.

         Divide dough into three parts; knead one-third of the apple
         mixture into each.  This will get easier with practice.  What I
         usually do is to pat a portion of dough out into a disk shape,
         maybe about 8 inches in diameter or so -- whatever it wants to do.
         Then I sprinkle some flour in the middle of the disk, dump the
         apple mixture in, spreading it out but with an inch or so margin
         all around the perimeter, and sprinkle more flour on top.  Then, I
         gather the edges to the middle, pressing them together to make a
         sack of dough around the apple mixture.  Then I start kneading.
         Shape each loaf into a round, flat ball.  Place each in a greased
         8-inch round baking pan that has been sprinkled with cornmeal.
         (If you don't have 3 such pans, don't despair -- you can use
         square pans as well.) Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1
         hour.

         For glaze, brush each loaf with egg and sprinkle with sugar.  Bake
         at 350 degrees for "30-35" minutes, or until bread sounds hollow
         when tapped.  (In my oven, it's usually 40 minutes.)


                                    APRICOT CHEWS

                                Yield: about 3 dozen


         This recipe is from the "Incredible Cookies" booklet inside the
         November 23, 1993 issue of "Woman's Day" magazine.


             2 cups sweetened flaked coconut
             1 cup finely chopped dried apricots (about 6 oz.)
           2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk (not evaporated milk)

         Heat the oven to 350 degrees and grease the cookie sheets.  Mix
         all ingredients until well blended.  At this point, the original
         recipe says to "roll rounded teaspoonfuls into balls".  I don't
         like that method, because the mixture is a sticky mess.  What I
         did instead was to use two spoons to deposit the blobs onto the
         cookie sheet, pushing any stray bits back into place with the
         spoons.  Then, at the very end, after all the sheet was full, I
         used a finger to touch up any stubborn bits.  (Home economist
         types always say to use two spoons for putting drop cookie dough
         on the sheet; I find that too awkward for general use and prefer
         to use a spoon and a finger, but this is an exceptional case.) The
         apricot chews won't be changing size in the oven, so you can place
         them fairly close together.  Bake 12 minutes "or until set" (or
         until the coconut looks as brown as you're willing to have it).
         Remove to wire rack to cool.  Store in airtight containers up to 2
         weeks.


                                  BLUEBERRY PUDDING

                              Yield: about 20 cupcakes
                                     or 4 dozen mini-muffins


         Although this recipe is called "pudding", it really makes
         something closer to a cupcake.  It is based on three recipes for
         "cherry or berry pudding" in the "Over the Line Cook Book"
         published by the Maryland Line United Methodist Church.  The
         editor didn't do much, so none of the recipes is what I would call
         complete.  They tend to leave out details like time, temperature,
         and measurements.  But, by combining the recipes, I was able to
         reconstruct something reasonable.  I don't know why this is called
         "pudding".  I suspect that the original idea may have been to
         serve it warm, in a bowl with cream poured over it.  Or, as I
         discovered in a trip to England in 2000, the term "pudding" may
         just be meant as a generic term for what we would call "dessert".


             1 cup sugar
             3 tablespoons butter, softened
             2 eggs
           2/3 cup milk
           1/2 teaspoon vanilla
             2 cups flour
             1 teaspoon baking powder
             1 pint blueberries and/or halved pitted cherries

         If you're superstitious, you can make a big deal out of creaming
         the butter and sugar first, and combining the flour and baking
         powder in a separate bowl before adding them to the rest; but it
         really makes no difference.  So, put everything except the
         blueberries in a bowl and mix well, then gently add the
         blueberries.  Because of the blueberries, you may want to line
         your muffin tin with cupcake papers.  Fill about 2/3 full with the
         batter, and bake at 350 degrees until done -- I don't remember
         exactly, but I think that's about 30 minutes.  (By the way, an ice
         cream scoop is great for portioning out any kind of cupcake or
         muffin batter.)


                            BROWN SUGAR PECAN SHORTBREAD

                                Yield:  4 to 5 dozen


         This recipe is from the 3/13/01 issue of Family Circle magazine.
         It's very easy to make, and delicious.  I've provisionally put in
         the yield from the recipe as written, but I think for typical
         Scout occasions I would want to make them a bit smaller, so the
         yield would increase proportionally.  The recipe also specified
         dipping the cooled cookies diagonally in melted bittersweet
         chocolate, but I have dispensed with that frill.


             1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
           2/3 cup packed light brown sugar
           1/2 teaspoon vanilla
             2 cups all-purpose flour
           1/4 teaspoon salt
             1 cup toasted chopped pecans

         Beat together the butter, brown sugar and vanilla until well
         blended.  Add the flour and salt.  Stir in the pecans.  Turn dough
         out on a sheet of plastic wrap.  Shape into a 6 x 4-1/2 inch
         rectangle.  (For smaller cookies, try an 8 x 3-1/2 inch
         rectangle.) Wrap securely and refrigerate several hours until
         completely chilled.  Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Line 2 large
         baking sheets with parchment paper or waxed paper.  Cut chilled
         dough lengthwise in half.  Working with one half of dough, and
         keeping the other half chilled, use a sharp knife to slice the
         dough crosswise into 1/4 inch slices.  Place the slices 1 inch
         apart on prepared baking sheets.  Repeat with the other half of
         dough.  Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown, switching and
         rotating the baking sheets halfway through the baking.  (Be
         careful when you do this -- the cookies are soft and it's easy to
         dent them with your thumb as you try to move the sheets without
         having the parchment slide off.) Remove the sheets to a wire rack
         to cool, then remove the cookies.


                            BUTTER PECAN TURTLE COOKIES

                             Yield:  13-in x 9-in pan


         This recipe is from the inside of a butter carton.  The original
         recipe only called for 1 cup of pecans, but that looked too sparse,
         so I've increased it.  These are very rich, so cut them in small
         pieces -- I get 5 dozen from the pan.


         Crust:
             2 cups all-purpose flour
             1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
           1/2 cup butter, softened
         1-1/2 cup pecan pieces
         Caramel Layer:
           2/3 cup butter
           1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
         Topping:
             1 cup milk chocolate chips

         Heat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large mixer bowl, combine all
         crust ingredients except pecans.  Beat at medium speed, scraping
         bowl often, until well mixed and particles are fine.  (You may
         have to squash some brown sugar lumps with fingers or a spoon.)
         Press on bottom of a 13x9- inch baking pan.  Sprinkle pecans
         evenly over unbaked crust.  In a one quart saucepan, combine
         butter and brown sugar.  Cook over medium heat, stirring
         constantly, until entire surface of mixture begins to boil.  Boil
         one minute, stirring constantly.  Pour evenly over pecans and
         crust.  Bake 18 to 24 minutes or until entire caramel layer is
         bubbly.  Remove from oven.  Immediately sprinkle with chips; allow
         to melt slightly (2 to 3 minutes), then swirl.  Cool completely;
         cut into bars.

         Served February, 1999 -- very popular with adults, but boys seemed
                                  to prefer the Mini-Choco Cupcakes.


                          CHERRY-CHEESE DANISH FOR A CROWD

                               Yield: 1 jelly roll pan

         This recipe came from the 9/1/94 issue of Woman's Day, and was
         attributed to Irene Gregorczyk.  I imagine that you could try
         other pie fillings in it besides cherry, although I never have.
         This does not have to be refrigerated immediately; it can be
         baked and kept at room temperature for up to one day.


             2 packages (8 oz. each) cream cheese, at room temperature
           1/2 cup sugar
             1 large egg
             2 teaspoons vanilla extract
             2 tubes (8 oz. each) refrigerated crescent roll dough
             1 can (21 oz.) cherry-pie filling, well drained
           Glaze:  Yolk of 1 egg beaten with 1 teaspoon water
           Garnish: Confectioners' sugar


         Heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Lightly butter a 15 1/2 x 10 1/2-in.
         jelly roll pan (cookie sheet with sides).  In a medium-size bowl,
         mix cream cheese, sugar, egg, and vanilla with a large wooden
         spoon until smooth.  Remove dough from 1 crescent-roll tube.
         Unroll and place in middle of prepared pan.  Pat out with fingers,
         pressing perforations together, until dough completely covers
         bottom of pan.  Warm in oven 4 minutes until slightly dry (to set
         bottom crust).  Remove from oven and cool slightly.  Spread cheese
         mixture over dough evenly to edges.  Scatter cherries evenly over
         cheese.  Unroll remaining sheet of crescent-roll dough and
         separate into 8 triangles along perforations.  Arrange triangles
         on top of cherries.  They will not completely cover the surface;
         just space them evenly -- there will be a little open area
         surrounding each triangle.  Brush triangles with egg glaze.  Bake
         30 minutes, or until top crust is golden and cheese mixture is
         set.  Cool in pan on wire rack.  Dust with confectioners' sugar
         before serving.  Serves 16.  Per serving:  278 cal, 5 g pro, 29 g
         car, 16 g fat, 58 mg chol, 323 mg sod.  Exchanges:  1
         starch/bread, 1 fruit, 3 fat


                                 CHEWY GRANOLA BARS

                               Yield: 13-in x 9-in pan

         This recipe was contributed to Taste of Home magazine by Virginia
         Krites, of Cridersville, Ohio in a "Motoring Munchies" feature.
         When made with raisins, it has a very fruity taste; sort of a
         cross between an oatmeal cookie and a Rice Krispie bar.  I haven't
         tried it with chocolate chips.


           1/2 cup butter, softened
             1 cup packed brown sugar
           1/4 cup sugar
             2 tablespoons honey
           1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
             1 egg
             1 cup flour
             1 teaspoon cinnamon
           1/2 teaspoon baking powder
           1/4 teaspoon salt
         1-1/2 cups quick-cooking oats
         1-1/4 cups crisp rice cereal
             1 cup chopped nuts
             1 cup raisins or semisweet chocolate chips, optional


         Cream butter and sugars.  Add honey, vanilla and egg; mix well.
         Combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt; add to creamed
         mixture.  Stir in oats, cereal, and nuts.  Add raisins or
         chocolate chips, if desired.  (This is a stiff, somewhat sticky
         mixture -- you may need to use your hands to finish up the
         "stirring in".) Press into a greased 13-in x 9-in x 2-in baking
         pan.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until the top is
         lightly browned.


                                CHOCOLATE CHIP COINS

                        Yield: 7 dozen from 1-1/2 inch rolls

         This recipe came from a "Bake Sale" feature in the 9/14/99 issue
         of Woman's Day.  It claims to make 360 cookies from 1-inch rolls,
         "perfect for snacking by the handful".  For Courts of Honor, I
         prefer to make them bigger, and discourage the handfuls.  An
         advantage of this recipe over ordinary chocolate chip cookies is
         that the rolls of dough can be prepared and frozen well ahead of
         time, with only the baking left to be done on the last day or two.


             1 cup butter, softened
           1/2 cup packed brown sugar
           1/2 cup sugar
             2 eggs
         1-1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
             1 teaspoon baking soda
         2-1/4 cups flour
             1 bag (12 oz) chocolate mini-chips


         Beat butter, sugars, eggs, vanilla, and baking soda in a large
         bowl with mixer on medium-high speed until pale and smooth.
         Reduce speed to low and beat in flour just until blended.  Stir in
         chocolate chips.  Cover and refrigerate 2 hours or until the dough
         is firm enough to handle.  Divide dough into rolls, wrap, and
         freeze at least 2 hours or until dough is firm enough to slice
         neatly.  When ready to bake:  heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cut one
         roll at a time into 1/4-inch slices.  Place 1 inch apart on
         ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake 8-10 minutes until very lightly
         browned.

         (The recipe originally specified 10 rolls, 1 inch in diameter and
         9 inches long; cookies placed 1/2 inch apart, and baked 5-7
         minutes.  I used 4 rolls, 1-1/2 inch in diameter, so they needed a
         little more room and baking time.)


                               CINNAMON CHOCOLATE CAKE

                           Yield: 15-in x 10-in x 1-in pan


         This recipe probably came from Taste of Home magazine.  It was
         contributed by Rosemary Woodrow, of Sparks, Nevada.  It is very
         similar to the "White Texas Sheet Cake", except for the flavoring.
         Like that one, it can be made in a hurry, since you don't have to
         soften the butter first, or wait a long time before frosting the
         cake.  I rarely have buttermilk in the house; I would use plain
         yogurt instead, or 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice with milk to make 1/2
         cup.  I might substitute milk for the whipping cream in the
         frosting, too.


             2 cups flour
             2 cups sugar
         1-1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
           1/4 teaspoon salt
             1 cup water
           1/2 cup vegetable oil
           1/2 cup butter or margarine
           1/4 cup baking cocoa
             2 eggs
           1/2 cup buttermilk
             1 teaspoon vanilla
             1 teaspoon baking soda
         FROSTING
           1/2 cup butter or margarine
           1/3 cup whipping cream
           1/4 cup baking cocoa
         1-1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
             3 cups confectioners' sugar
             1 teaspoon vanilla extract
             1 cup finely chopped walnuts


         In a mixing bowl, combine the first four ingredients.  In a
         saucepan, combine water, oil, butter, and cocoa; bring to a boil
         over medium heat.  Pour over dry ingredients; mix well.  Add eggs,
         buttermilk, vanilla, and baking soda; mix well.  Pour into a
         greased and floured 15-in x 10-in x 1-in baking pan.  Bake at 375
         degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near
         the center comes out clean.  Meanwhile, for frosting, combine the
         butter, cream, cocoa, and cinnamon in a saucepan.  Cook and stir
         over medium heat until butter is melted and mixture is heated
         through.  Remove from the heat; beat in sugar and vanilla until
         smooth.  Stir in walnuts.  Carefully spread over hot cake.  Cool
         completely.  Makes "24-30 servings".


                                  COCONUT-LIME BARS

                           Yield: 13-in x 9-in x 2-in pan


         This recipe came from a women's magazine, either "Family Circle"
         or "Woman's Day".  The bars are very sweet and sticky, so cut them
         small.  Even my husband liked them, and he thinks he doesn't like
         coconut.  You can use dark brown sugar, but it will be easier to
         tell when the first stage of baking is finished if you use light
         brown sugar.

                                 COCONUT WASHBOARDS

                                Yield: about 9 dozen


         This recipe is from the October/November, 1995 issue of "Taste
         of Home".  It was contributed by Tommie Sue Shaw of McAlester,
         Oklahoma.  It makes a lot of cookies without a great deal of
         work.


           1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
           1/2 cup shortening
             2 cups packed brown sugar
             2 eggs
           1/4 cup water
             1 teaspoon vanilla extract
             4 cups all-purpose flour
         1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder
           1/2 teaspoon baking soda
           1/4 teaspoon salt
             1 cup flaked coconut


         In a mixing bowl, cream butter, shortening, and sugar for 2
         minutes or until fluffy.  Add eggs; mix well.  Gradually add water
         and vanilla; mix well.  Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda,
         and salt; add to the creamed mixture.  Fold in coconut.  Cover and
         refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours.  Shape into 1-inch balls.  Place 2
         inches apart on greased baking sheets; flatten with fingers into
         2-1/2-inch x 1-inch oblong shapes.  Press lengthwise with a
         floured fork (for the "washboard" effect).  Bake at 400 degrees
         for 8 to 10 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool 2 minutes
         before removing to a wire rack.


                               CREAM CHEESE POUND CAKE

                              Yield: 1 10-in. tube pan


         This recipe is from one of the Reiman publications.  It was
         submitted by Mrs. Michael Ewanek, of Hastings, Pennsylvania.
         Look before you leap!  Yes, there are only six ingredients,
         but the recipe calls for a LOT of mixing.  If you don't have
         a stand mixer, you will probably wish that you did.  The result
         is delicious, though.  (And, no, I don't have a stand mixer,
         either.)  No icing is required, and the cake can be sliced
         neatly into around 30 thin slices.


         1-1/2 cup butter (no substitutes), room temperature
             1 package (8 oz.) cream cheese, room temperature
         2-1/3 cups sugar
             6 eggs, room temperature
             3 cups flour
             1 teaspoon vanilla extract


         In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and cream cheese.  Gradually
         add sugar, beating until light and fluffy, about 5-7 minutes.  Add
         eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Gradually
         add flour, beat just until blended.  Stir in vanilla.  Pour into a
         greased and floured 10-in.  tube pan.  Bake at 300 degrees F.  for
         1-1/2 hours or until cake tests done.  Cool in pan 15 minutes
         before removing to a wire rack.  Cool completely.


                         DECADENT CHOCOLATE CHERRY FRUITCAKE

                        Yield: 1 loaf or 4 dozen mini-muffins


         This recipe is from a Pillsbury Quick Bread Mix ad.  Don't let the
         word "fruitcake" scare you off -- everyone likes this!  I found it
         just a bit messy for a Court of Honor when made in a loaf and
         using the glaze, so I developed the mini-muffin alternative for
         that use.  My mini-muffin tins have a non-stick coating, so I just
         spray with Pam, rather than greasing and flouring them.


         Fruitcake:
             1 package Pillsbury Nut or Date Quick Bread Mix
             1 cup coarsely chopped pecans
             1 10-oz. jar maraschino cherries, drained, cut in half
           3/4 cup miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips
             1 cup water
             2 teaspoons almond extract
             1 tablespoon oil  (increase to 1/4 cup for mini-muffins)
             1 egg
         Glaze (if making a loaf):
           1/4 cup miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips
             2 teaspoons oil


         In a large mixing bowl, combine all fruitcake ingredients.  Stir
         by hand until mix is moistened.  Pour into a greased and floured
         loaf pan or spoon into mini-muffin cups.  For a loaf, bake at 350
         degrees F.  for 65 to 80 minutes for an 8x4-inch loaf or 60 to 70
         minutes for a 9x5-inch loaf.  For mini-muffins, bake at 400
         degrees F.  for 15 to 20 minutes.  In any event, the fruitcake is
         done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out "clean"
         (other than having melted chocolate on it).  Remove mini-muffins
         to a rack to cool immediately; let the loaf cool in the pan for 15
         minutes before removing.  Cool completely

         For glaze:  melt chips and oil in a small saucepan over low
         heat, stirring until smooth.  Drizzle over the top of the loaf
         and refrigerate to set the glaze.

         Wrapped well in plastic wrap, the loaves can be stored up to
         2 weeks in the refrigerator or 3 months in the freezer.  The
         recipe says "for optimum flavor, refrigerate at least 24 hours
         before serving".  This was obviously written by people with more
         spare refrigerator space than I have.  It tastes fine at room
         temperature.


                     DOUBLE CHOCOLATE POTATO PARTY SQUARES

                           Yield: 15-in x 10-in x 1-in pan


         This recipe is from the September, 2001 issue of "Yankee" magazine,
         from an article on potatoes.  They're not terribly sweet; the
         introduction suggests that they could be spread with a cream cheese
         frosting and served as a cake, as an alternative to the recipe's
         suggestion of merely sprinkling with powdered sugar.  My husband's
         first impression was "too bad, a cake-type brownie", but by the
         fourth piece he decided that maybe he did like them after all.


           3/4 cup (1-1/2 sticks) butter, softened
             1 cup granulated sugar
             1 cup ligt brown sugar, packed
             2 eggs
             1 cup mashed potatoes, at room temperature
             1 teaspoon vanilla
         2-1/2 cups flour
           1/4 cup baking cocoa
             1 teaspoon salt
             1 teaspoon baking soda
             1 cup buttermilk
             1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
             1 cup chopped pecans
         Confectioners' sugar (for dusting)


         In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugars until light and
         fluffy.  Beat in the eggs.  Add the mashed potatoes and vanilla
         and beat until smooth.  In a separate bowl, combine the flour,
         cocoa, salt, and baking soda.  Add these dry ingredients to the
         batter alternately with the buttermilk, mixing well.  Stir in the
         chocolate chips and nuts.  Pour into a greased 15x10x1-inch pan
         (a "jelly roll pan"), spreading to the edges and smoothing the
         top.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 22 to 25 minutes, until the top
         is springy when lightly touched and a tested inserted in the
         center comes out clean.  Cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes,
         then cut into squares.  (The original recipe said 24 to 36 squares;
         I think even 36 is larger than is really convenient when served
         as finger food.)  Dust with confectioners' sugar shortly before
         serving -- after a while, the sugar will disappear into the
         squares.


                                 DUNKABLE BROWNIES

                               Yield:  about 6 dozen


         This recipe was really named "BAKER'S One Bowl Chocolate Brownie
         Cookies" in the magazine ad it came from, and (of course) called
         specifically for BAKER'S chocolate and CALUMET baking powder.  I
         usually have unsweetened baking chocolate on hand, but not semi-
         sweet or bittersweet, so most of the time I substitute 6 ounces
         (1 cup) of semi-sweet chocolate bits.  You can easily toast nuts
         in the microwave -- use high power and stir frequently; remember
         they may continue to darken after you take them out of the oven.


             6 ounces semi-sweet or bittersweet baking chocolate
             4 ounces unsweetened baking chocolate
             6 tablespoons butter
         1-1/4 cups sugar
             3 eggs
             2 teaspoons vanilla
             1 cup flour
             1 teaspoon baking powder
           1/4 teaspoon salt
             2 cups toasted chopped walnuts (optional)


         Heat oven to 325 degrees.  Microwave chocolate and butter in a
         large microwavable bowl on HIGH for 1-1/2 to 2 minutes, or until
         chocolate is almost melted, stirring halfway through heating time.
         Stir until chocolate is completely melted and smooth.  Stir sugar
         into chocolate until blended.  Mix in eggs and vanilla.  Stir in
         flour, baking powder, and salt.  Stir in nuts.  Drop by rounded
         teaspoonfuls, 1 inch apart, onto ungreased baking sheet.  Bake
         12 minutes or until set.  DO NOT OVERBAKE.  Cool 5 minutes;
         remove from cookie sheet.  Cool completely on wire racks.  Store
         in an airtight container.


                                    HARVEST CAKE

                                 Yield: 1 tube cake


         This is a recipe I got from my mother; I think she got it from the
         newspaper.  What size tube pan?  The size that my mother had, of
         course!  I think that it must have been a 9-inch tube pan, because
         this looks a bit lost in a 10-inch pan.  Most of the time, though,
         I make a half recipe and bake it in an 8-in x 4-in loaf pan.  I've
         also been known to make a whole recipe and bake it in a 9-in x
         13-in sheet cake pan.  When you use different pan sizes, the time
         will vary, too.


             4 cups diced apples
             2 cups sugar
             3 cups flour
             1 cup salad oil
             2 eggs
             1 cup chopped nuts
             2 teaspoons soda
             1 teaspoon salt
             1 teaspoon cinnamon
             1 teaspoon nutmeg
             1 teaspoon vanilla


         Mix together apples and sugar, let stand one hour.  Sift dry
         ingredients together.  Beat eggs, add oil and vanilla.  Add apples.
         Add flour mixture.  Add nuts.  Bake in greased, lined, and floured
         tube pan at 350 degrees for 1 hour.  No icing is needed.


                                HOLIDAY BAKLAVA CUPS

                                  Yield: 30 pieces


         This recipe is from the December 12, 2000 issue of "Woman's Day"
         magazine.  I see no reason that you couldn't use other
         combinations of fruits and nuts in the filling, so long as they
         total one cup.  The recipe claims they can be made up to two weeks
         ahead, stored airtight at room temperature with waxed paper
         between layers.  I think they're probably better fresh, though.
         You won't be able to stack them on a serving platter, unless
         you're willing to have waxed paper between the layers there, too.
         So you probably want to restrict use of this recipe to times when
         you don't need a huge amount.  I've used it for a Troop Committee
         meeting, with only about a dozen attending.

         0 mg cholesterol, 44 mg sodium


         Filling:
           1/3 cup shelled pistachios
           1/3 cup whole natural (with skins) almonds
           1/3 cup sweetened dried cranberries, coarsely chopped
           1/4 cup sugar
           1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
         Syrup:
           1/2 cup sugar
           1/2 cup water
             1 unpeeled thin lemon slice
             2 whole cloves (maybe only 1 if using a less assertive fruit)
             3 tablespoons honey
             1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
          2 boxes (15 pieces each) frozen mini fillo (phyllo) pastry shells


         Heat oven to 375 degrees F.  Spread nuts on a rimmed baking sheet
         and bake 6 to 8 minutes, stirring once or twice, until lightly
         toasted.  (Leave the oven on -- you'll need it and the baking
         sheet again.) When cool enough to handle, chop the nuts coarsely,
         place them in a small bowl, and stir in the remaining filling
         ingredients.  Start preparing the syrup, so it can be cooking
         while you finish up the rest.

         Syrup:  Place the sugar, water, lemon slice, and clove(s) in a
         medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and boil gently,
         without stirring, 12 to 15 minutes, until slightly thickened.
         Remove from heat, discard lemon slice and clove(s), and stir
         in the honey and lemon juice.

         Meanwhile ... arrange the fillo shells on the rimmed baking sheet,
         and spoon the filling into each shell.  (The shells will be full.)
         Bake 12 to 14 minutes, until the cups are lightly browned.  While
         still on the baking sheet, spoon about half a tablespoon of hot
         syrup over the hot filling in each cup.  Cool on the baking sheet
         on a wire rack.


                                HONEY-ALMOND STRIPS

                            Yield: 15-1/2 x 10-1/2 pan


         This recipe came from a Christmas cookie article in either Family
         Circle or Woman's Day magazine.  I have never made the brandy
         variation.  The first several times I made these, I marveled at
         the unconcern with which the recipe said "spread glaze evenly over
         crust", since it really didn't want to spread at all.  Eventually
         I realized that the testers had no problem because they used the
         1/4 cup brandy instead of only 1 tablespoon water, and theirs
         did spread more easily.  Since then, I have used 1-1/2 or 2
         tablespoons of liquid, and it's a lot easier.  I like to use
         orange juice, rather than water, for more flavor.  I've also used
         1/4 teaspoon of lemon juice (in addition to some water) when I
         didn't have any orange juice thawed.

         Nutritional Analysis:  Per strip:  47 calories, 1 g protein,
         5 g carbohydrate,  3 g fat, 10 mg cholesterol, 26 mg sodium


         Crust:
         1-3/4 cups flour
           1/2 cup packed light-brown sugar
           1/2 cup butter, at room temperature
             1 egg
             1 teaspoon almond extract
         Honey-Almond Glaze:
           1/3 cup butter
           1/4 cup sugar
           1/4 cup brandy or 1 tablespoon water  (SEE NOTE)
             2 tablespoons honey
             1 teaspoon almond extract
             1 cup sliced almonds


         Line bottom and sides of a 15-1/2 x 10-1/2-inch jelly roll pan
         with foil; lightly grease foil.  To make crust:  mix flour and
         brown sugar in a medium-size bowl.  Cut in butter until mixture
         resembles fine crumbs.  Make a well in center; add egg and almond
         extract.  Beat egg with fork, then stir into flour mixture until
         well blended and dough forms a ball.  Chill about 10 minutes until
         firm; press into bottom of prepared pan.  Chill while preparing
         glaze.  To make glaze:  stir all ingredients except almonds in a
         small saucepan over medium heat until butter melts and sugar
         dissolves.  Remove from heat; stir in almonds and cool slightly
         (about 5 minutes).  Meanwhile, heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Spread
         glaze evenly over crust.  Bake "30 to 35" minutes until almonds
         are lightly browned.  (Keep an eye on them; they didn't take that
         long in my oven.) Cool completely in pan.  Lift foil by ends onto
         cutting board.  Cut into 2x1-inch strips.  Makes 75.


                                 HONEY WALNUT DROPS

                              Yield: about 4-1/2 dozen


         This recipe is from "The Cookie Cookbook" by Evelyne Johnson, a
         1979 Dell Purse Book.  These cookies are a lot like butterscotch
         candy, except for having a crumbly cookie texture.  (I wonder if
         there ought to have been some baking soda in the recipe -- but
         folks seem to like them fine as is.) The original recipe claimed
         to make 8 dozen; I only got 4-3/4 dozen of what I consider to be a
         normal-sized cookie, which is not very large.  The recipe didn't
         specify whether or not to grease the cookie sheet; I guessed at
         ungreased, which turns out to work.

         Variations:  The book suggests making "honey almond drops" by
         substituting sliced almonds for the walnuts and adding 1 teaspoon
         of almond extract.  I expect that "honey pecan drops" would be
         good, too.


             1 cup butter, at room temperature
             1 cup packed brown sugar
           1/2 cup honey
             2 cups flour
             1 cup chopped walnuts
             1 teaspoon vanilla


         Cream butter and sugar.  Add remaining ingredients and mix well.
         Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls on ungreased cookie sheet, 2 inches
         apart.  Bake 8 to 12 minutes, until lightly browned.  Leave them
         on the cookie sheet for a few minutes until the cookies are firm
         enough to remove without breaking apart.  Cool on wire racks.


                                    IRISH BREAD

                                Yield: 1 round loaf


         This recipe is from the March 1993 issue of "Country Extra"
         magazine (a sibling and fore=runner of "Taste of Home").  It was
         contributed by Martha Glenn from Enid, Oklahoma.  It does contain
         a tiny bit of baking soda, so you could call it "Irish soda
         bread", but the yeast makes it very different from what you
         usually find under that name.  The recipe says to use a baking
         sheet, but I usually use one of the 8-inch round pans that I use
         with the Apple Raisin Bread.  When using pans, you should grease
         AND FLOUR.  The original recipe says "all-purpose flour", but I
         use "bread flour" when I have it on hand.  If you don't have
         buttermilk, you could use plain yogurt, or mix one tablespoon of
         lemon juice with milk to make one cup.


         2-3/4 cups flour, divided
             3 tablespoons sugar
             1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
           1/2 teaspoon salt
           1/2 teaspoon baking soda
             1 cup warm buttermilk (120-130 degrees)
             2 tablespoons butter, melted
           3/4 cups raisins


         Combine 2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, salt, and baking soda.
         Combine buttermilk and butter; gradually add to dry ingredients,
         and beat well.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface; knead in
         raisins and enough remaining flour to make a soft dough, about 6-8
         minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top,
         cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled -- about 1-1/2
         hours.  Punch dough down.  Knead on a lightly floured surface
         about 15 times, forming a smooth round ball.  Place on a greased
         baking sheet.  Press dough down to form an 8-inch circle.  Cover
         and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.  Sprinkle dough
         lightly with flour; cut a 4-inch cross about 1/4-inch deep on the
         top.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until bread tests
         done.  Remove to a wire rack.


                                   JEWELED COOKIES

                                Yield: 12 to 14 dozen!


         This recipe is from the December/January 1996 issue of "Taste of
         Home" magazine, and was contributed by Ruth Ann Stelfax of
         Raymond, Alberta.  You will need a very large bowl for mixing it.
         The recipe says to add the eggs one at a time, but you can just as
         well put them in all at once.


             1 pound butter (not margarine this time), softened
         2-1/2 cups sugar
             3 eggs
             5 cups flour
             1 teaspoon baking soda
         1-1/2 cups raisins
             1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
           1/2 cup chopped red candied cherries
           1/2 cup chopped green candied cherries
           1/2 cup chopped candied pineapple


         In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar.  Add eggs, one at a
         time, beating well after each.  Combine flour and baking soda; add
         to creamed mixture.  Stir in raisins, nuts, cherries, and
         pineapple; mix well.  Shape into 2-in.  rolls; wrap in waxed paper
         or foil.  Freeze at least 2 hours.  cut into 1/4-in.  slices;
         place on greased baking sheets.  Bake at 350 degrees F.  for 8 to
         10 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool on wire racks.


                                     LEMON CAKE

                                    Yield: 1 loaf


         This recipe is from "Yankee" magazine, probably an issue from the
         fall of 2000.  I think that the original recipe called for too much
         glaze, so I've cut the amount by 25% here.  (With the full amount,
         the slices from the ends of the loaf are pretty soggy.)  I wonder
         if it would be a good idea to line the bottom of the loaf pan; it
         would make the loaf easier to extract, but might interfere with
         soaking up the glaze.  Or maybe it should really be handled like
         the Poppy Seed Bread -- only leave it in the pan for 5 minutes
         after glazing.


         1-1/2 cups flour
           1/4 teaspoon baking powder
             a pinch of baking soda
             1 cup sugar
           1/2 cup butter
             3 eggs
           1/2 cup sour cream
             2 tablespoons finely grated lemon zest
         Glaze:
           1/4 cup sugar
           1/4 cup lemon juice


         Combine flour, baking powder, and baking soda; set aside.  In a
         large bowl, beat the sugar and butter together until light, then
         beat in the eggs, one at a time.  Beat in the dry ingredients
         alternately with the sour cream, then stir in the lemon zest.
         Turn batter into a greased 4-1/2 x 8 x 2-1/2-inch loaf pan.
         Bake at 350 degrees F. until top is golder brown, edges are
         shrinking from the pan, and a toothpick comes out clean.  That
         will probably be 50-60 minutes.  Mix the glaze ingredients
         together and spoon over the hot cake while it is still in the
         pan.  Allow the cake to cool before removing it from the pan.


                                  LEMON CHEESE BRAID

                                Yield: 12 to 14 servings


         This recipe came from a coupon packet included with "Taste of Home"
         magazine, and was contributed by Grace Dickey of Vernonia, Oregon.
         (It probably appeared in an earlier issue of "Taste of Home" or
         "Country".)  You will need to provide plates when serving this --
         the filling and icing make it messy, although chilling the bread
         will help firm the filling.


             1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
             3 tablespoons warm water (110 to 115 degrees F)
           1/4 cup sugar
           1/3 cup milk
           1/4 cup butter, melted
             2 eggs
           1/2 teaspoon salt
             3 to 3-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
         Filling:
             2 packages (one 8-ounce, one 3-ounce) cream cheese, softened
           1/2 cup sugar
             1 egg
             1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
         Icing:
           1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
             2 to 3 teaspoons milk
           1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract


         In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water; let stand for 5
         minutes.  Add sugar, milk, butter, eggs, salt and some of the
         flour; beat on low speed for 3 minutes.  (The original recipe
         specifies "2 cups" of flour; I found that to be more than my
         hand-held mixer could cope with.  Try 1-1/2 cups instead.) Stir in
         enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough.  Knead on a
         floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.
         Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and
         let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.  Meanwhile,
         beat filling ingredients in a mixing bowl until fluffy; set aside.
         Punch dough down.  On a floured surface, roll into a 14-in.  x
         12-in.  rectangle.  PLACE ON A GREASED BAKING SHEET.  (If you
         don't do that at this point, you'll be sorry!) Spread filling down
         center third of rectangle.  On each long side, cut 1-in.-wide
         strips, 3-in.  into center.  Starting at one end, fold alternating
         strips at an angle across filling.  Seal end.  Cover and let rise
         for 30 minutes.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until
         golden brown.  (In my oven, it took more like 20 minutes.) Cool.
         Combine icing ingredients; drizzle over bread.


                                    LEMON CRISPS

                                 Yield: 4 to 5 dozen


         This recipe is from "Woman's Day" magazine.  They recommend that
         you NOT use an insulated cookie sheet for this recipe.  The
         nutritional analysis is figured at 44 cookies per batch; I got
         more than that.

         Nutritional Analysis:  One cookie equals 52 calories, 35 mg sodium,
         10 mg cholesterol (with butter), 7 g carbohydrate, 1 g protein,
         3 g fat.
         Diabetic Exchange:  1/4 starch, 1/4 other car, 1/2 fat


           1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
           3/4 cup sugar
             1 egg
             1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon peel
         1-1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
           3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
           1/2 teaspoon baking powder
           1/4 teaspoon baking soda
         1-1/4 cups all-purpose flour
         Garnish:
           1/2 cup sliced almonds or 1/4 cup sugar


         Heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Have cookie sheet(s) ready.  Beat
         butter and sugar in large bowl with mixer on high speed until
         fluffy.  Beat in remaining ingredients except flour until well
         blended.  On low speed, beat in flour just until blended.  Drop
         by rounded teaspoonfuls 1-1/2 inches apart on ungreased cookie
         sheet.  Sprinkle with almonds or sugar.  Bake 10 to 12 minutes
         until edges are lightly browned.  Cool on cookie sheet 1 minute
         before removing to wire rack to cool completely.  (These cookies
         harden quickly, so don't dilly-dally about removing them after
         the minute is up, or they'll get stuck.)  Store airtight at room
         temperature for up to one week.


                              LICORICE COOKIE STRIPS

                               Yield: about 8 dozen


         This recipe was contributed to "Quick Cooking" magazine by Dolores
         Hunt, of Florence Montana.  They are quite tasty, and a definite
         change-of-pace.  The kind of nuts isn't specified; I usually use
         walnuts.


             1 cup butter, softened
             1 cup sugar
             1 cup packed brown sugar
             1 egg
         2-1/2 cups flour
             2 teaspoons aniseed
             1 teaspoon baking soda
           1/2 teaspoon salt
           1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
           1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
           1/2 cup chopped nuts


         Cream butter and sugars.  Beat in egg.  Combine dry ingredients;
         add to creamed mixture, and beat well.  Stir in nuts.  Divide
         dough into 10 portions; shape each into a 12-inch log.  Place 3
         inches apart on ungreased baking sheets.  (You may want to use
         baking parchment to protect the baking sheet, since you will be
         cutting the cookie strips after baking.) Flatten with a fork to a
         1/4-inch thickness.  Bake at 350 degrees F.  for 8 to 10 minutes
         or until golden brown.  Cool for 5 minutes; cut diagonally into
         1-inch slices.  Remove to wire racks to cool completely.


                               LO-CAL MOLASSES COOKIES

                                 Yield: 4 to 5 dozen


         This recipe is from the October/November 1998 issue of "Taste of
         Home" magazine, and was contributed by Kim Marie Van Rheenen,
         Mendota, Ill.  They will be small cookies with cracked tops and
         soft centers.  I use "Grandma's" brand of molasses, which has a
         mild flavor.  There are other more strongly flavored brands
         available, if you prefer.

         Nutritional Analysis:  One cookie equals 41 calories, 44 mg
         sodium, 4 mg cholesterol, 5 g carbohydrate, 1 g protein, 2 g fat.
         Diabetic Exchange:  1/2 starch


           1/2 cup vegetable oil
           1/4 cup molasses
           1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, divided
             1 egg
             2 cups all-purpose flour
             2 teaspoons baking soda
             1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
           1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
           1/4 teaspoon ground cloves


         In a mixing bowl, beat oil, molasses, 1/4 cup sugar, and egg.
         Combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves; add to
         molasses mixture and mix well.  Cover and refrigerate for at least
         2 hours.  Shape into 1-in balls; roll in remaining sugar.  (You
         may need to use a little bit more sugar to coat all of them.)
         Place on ungreased baking sheets.  Bake at 375 degrees F.  for 10
         to 12 minutes or until cookies are set and surface cracks.


                                LOUISIANA RING CAKE

                                 Yield: 1 tube pan


         I got this recipe from my mother; I believe she got it from a
         newspaper many years ago.  It won't easily cut into thin slices,
         so it's not an ideal choice for the typical Scout gathering.
         Figure on about 24 slices from a 10-inch pan.


         2-3/4 cups flour
             2 teaspoons baking powder
         1-1/2 teaspoons salt
         1-3/4 cups sugar
             1 cup shortening
           3/4 cup milk
             1 teaspoon orange extract
           1/4 teaspoon almond extract
             3 eggs
         Topping:
           3/4 cup Louisiana ring cake batter
             2 tablespoons flour
             3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
             3 tablespoons brown sugar
           1/4 teaspoon orange extract

         Grease a 9 or 10-inch tube pan -- preferably not a bundt pan.
         Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.  Cut in
         the shortening.  Add the milk and extracts, and mix.  Add the eggs
         and mix well.  In a separate bowl, mix the topping ingredients.
         Spread the topping in the bottom of the pan.  Pour the batter on
         top.  Bake 45-60 minutes at 350 degrees F.  Turn out of the pan
         immediately upon removal from oven.  (My mother used a 9-inch pan;
         following these instructions with a 10-inch pan resulted in a
         crunchier crust than I remember.  Probably the temperature should
         be reduced a little for the larger pan.)


                          MARTHA LOGAN'S SAUCEPAN BROWNIES

                               Yield: 13 X 9-inch pan


         This was contributed to the Maryland Line Methodist Church "Over
         the Line" cookbook by Mrs. Barbara J. Groth.  The original
         recipe was for a 9-inch square pan, using half the ingredients
         shown here, but it's scarcely worth bothering to make such a
         little bit.  When my son was young, he didn't much care for
         cake, so for his birthday I decorated a pan of brownies with
         birthday cake icing.  The mini-chocolate chips are my own idea.


             1 cup (2 sticks) butter
             4 ounces unsweetened baking chocolate
             2 cups sugar
             1 cup flour
             2 teaspoons baking powder
             2 teaspoons vanilla
             4 eggs
         Optional Additions:
             1 cup mini-chocolate chips
                 and/or
             1 to 2 cups chopped nuts

         Melt the butter and chocolate in a large saucepan.  Remove from
         heat.  Add the sugar, then the flour and baking powder, then
         the vanilla and eggs.  Add chocolate chips and nuts, if using.
         Pour into a greased 13 x 9-inch pan.  Bake at 350 degrees F for
         about 35 minutes, until the brownies test done.

         Note:  when using nuts, I add half to the batter and sprinkle the
         rest on top after pouring the batter in the pan.  That way, those
         who care can easily tell which brownies have nuts and which don't.


                             MILK CHOCOLATE BUNDT CAKE

                             Yield: 10-inch bundt pan


         This recipe was submitted to "Taste of Home" magazine by Sharan
         Williams, of Spanish Fork, Utah.  This is a moist cake that
         doesn't require frosting and is easy to cut into thin slices
         that don't make a lot of crumbs.  Figure on about 36 slices
         per pan.  I was a little worried about only 1/2 teaspoon baking
         soda in the batter, but it comes out fine.  If you're not going
         to dust with confectioners' sugar, you probably want to "flour"
         the pan with cocoa, rather than flour.


             1 milk chocolate candy bar (7 ounces)
           1/2 cup chocolate syrup
             1 cup butter or margarine, softened
         1-1/2 cups sugar
             4 eggs
             1 teaspoon vanilla extract
             1 teaspoon orange extract
         2-3/4 cups flour
           1/2 teaspoon salt
           1/2 teaspoon baking soda
             1 cup buttermilk
         Confectioners' sugar, optional

         In a saucepan, heat the candy bar and chocolate syrup over low
         heat until melted, set aside to cool.  In a mixing bowl, cream
         butter and sugar.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after
         each addition.  Stir in chocolate mixture and extracts.  Combine
         flour, salt, and baking soda; add to creamed mixture alternately
         with buttermilk.  Pour into a greased and floured 10-inch fluted
         tube pan.  Bake at 350 degrees F. for 60-70 minutes or until a
         toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.  Cool in pan
         on a wire rack for 15 minutes.  Remove from pan and cool completely.
         Dust with confectioners' sugar, if desired.


                                 MINI-CHOCO CUPCAKES

                        Yield: 24 regular or 60 mini cupcakes

         This is another recipe from the "Taste of Home" magazine, but I
         don't know the contributor.  In her opinion, a cupcake should be
         "more than just cake batter baked in a muffin tin", and these
         cupcakes do have a firmer texture than most.  They're also
         surprisingly chocolaty.


         2-1/2 cups flour
         2-1/2 teaspoons baking powder
           1/2 teaspoon salt
             1 cup butter or margarine, softened
         1-1/2 cups sugar
         1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
             4 eggs
             1 cup milk
             1 cup semisweet mini chocolate chips
         Confectioners' sugar


         In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt;
         set aside.  In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar.  Add vanilla.
         Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
         Alternately add dry ingredients and milk, beginning and ending
         with dry ingredients; beat well after each addition.  Stir in
         chocolate chips.  Line regular or mini muffin cups with baking
         papers.  Fill each 2/3 full.  Bake at 400 degrees for 14-20
         minutes or until muffins test done.  Cool.  Dust with
         confectioners' sugar.  (For mini-muffins, reduce temperature to
         375, and watch carefully.)


                                    MONKEY BARS

                           Yield: one 9-inch square pan

         This is a recipe I clipped from some magazine, probably "Family
         Circle" or "Woman's Day".  I really didn't like them; I thought
         they were obviously low-fat.  That didn't seem to stop them from
         disappearing at the Court of Honor, though.

         Nutritional Analysis:  If cut into 12 bars, each bar contains
         180 calories, 5 g fat (1 g saturated),  32 g carbohydrate,
         4 g protein, 55 mg sodium, 18 mg cholesterol


             1 cup mashed ripe banana
           3/4 cup packed brown sugar
           1/3 cup granulated sugar
           1/4 cup buttermilk
             1 egg
             1 tablespoon vegetable oil
             2 teaspoons vanilla
         1-1/4 cups flour
             1 teaspoon baking powder
           1/2 cup chopped walnuts
           1/4 cup chocolate confectioners' sugar
             2 teaspoons water


         Beat together banana and sugars.  Add buttermilk, egg, oil, and
         vanilla, beating well.  Combine flour with baking powder and stir
         into the banana mixture just until blended.  Fold in nuts.  Spread
         batter in a greased 9-inch square baking pan.  Bake at 350 degrees
         F.  for 25 to 30 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in center
         comes out clean.  Cool in pan on wire rack.  Stir together
         confectioners' sugar and water in a small cup until smooth.  (Add
         more water, a drop at a time if necessary for a better drizzling
         consistency.) Drizzle over cooled cake; cut into bars.


                               NUTS FOR CHOCOLATE BARS

                             Yield: one 13 X 9-inch pan

         I've only made this once, and was unimpressed with it.  The bars
         are gooey, and somehow not as delectable as they ought to be with
         the ingredients involved.  On the other hand, the adults at the
         event thought they were wonderful, and ate them in preference to
         brownies or shortbread.  The recipe came from a magazine
         advertisement, promoting Diamond nuts, Karo corn syrup, and
         Baker's chocolate.



             2 cups flour
             1 cup sugar, divided
           3/4 cup (1-1/2 sticks) butter, divided
             4 ounces German's sweet chocolate
             1 cup (light or dark) corn syrup
             3 eggs
         1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla
         1-1/2 cups chopped walnuts


         Mix flour and 1/2 cup of the sugar.  Cut in 1/2 cup of the butter
         until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Press firmly on the
         bottom of a greased, foil-lined 13 x 9-inch baking pan.  Bake at
         350 degrees F for 20 minutes, or until edges are lightly browned.
         Microwave the chocolate and the remaining 1/4 cup butter on high
         for 1-1/2 minutes, or until butter is melted.  Stir until chocolate
         is completely melted.  Stir in corn syrup, remaining 1/2 cup sugar,
         eggs, and vanilla.  Pour over crust, sprinkle with walnuts.  Bake
         another 30 minutes or until filling is set.  Cool in pan and cut
         into bars.


                              NUTTY CHEESECAKE SQUARES

                              Yield: 13-in. x 9-in. pan

         This is another recipe from one of the Reiman publications.  It
         was contributed by Ruth Simon, of Buffalo, New York.  I was
         looking for a cheesecake sort of recipe that could be handled
         neatly in a finger-food situation, but wouldn't require as much
         work on the cook's part as the typical mini-muffin version.  These
         weren't quite as neat as I had hoped, when cut into 24 pieces, but
         I think they might do if cut smaller.  Certainly, they're fine if
         you have plates and forks.


             2 cups flour
             1 cup finely chopped walnuts
           2/3 cup packed brown sugar  (preferably light brown sugar)
           1/2 teaspoon salt
           2/3 cup butter or margarine
         FILLING:
             2 packages (8 oz. each) cream cheese, softened
           1/2 cup sugar
             2 eggs
           1/4 cup milk
             1 teaspoon vanilla extract


         In a bowl, combine flour, walnuts, brown sugar, and salt; cut in
         butter ntil mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Set half aside;
         press remaining crumb mixture onto the bottom of a greased 13-in.
         x 9-in.  x 2-in.  baking pan.  Bake at 350 degrees F.  for 10-15
         minutes, or until lightly browned.  In a mixing bowl, beat filling
         ingredients until smooth; pour over crust.  Sprinkle with reserved
         crumb mixture.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until a
         knife inserted near the center comes out clean.  Cool completely.
         Store in the refrigerator.


                                   OATMEAL COOKIES

                                  Yield: 3-1/2 dozen

         This is my mother's oatmeal cookie recipe; it probably came from a
         newspaper long ago.  This is a chewy cookie, not the soft kind,
         and has always been my father's favorite.  It's unusual for a
         cookie recipe, since it uses salad oil, rather than butter or
         shortening.


             1 cup flour
           1/2 teaspoon baking soda
           1/2 teaspoon salt
           1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
           1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
           3/4 cup raisins
           1/2 cup salad oil
           1/4 cup water
             1 cup packed brown sugar
             1 teaspoon vanilla
         1-1/2 cups uncooked rolled oats (quick is OK, but not instant)
           1/2 cup chopped nuts


         Sift dry ingredients together.  Rinse and drain raisins, mix with
         salad oil and water, then add sugar.  Add next 3 ingredients, then
         flour mixture.  Chill 1 hour.  Drop by teaspoonfuls, 2 inches
         apart on a greased cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 degrees until done
         -- probably 8-10 minutes.  Allow to cool very slightly before
         removing from sheet.


                            OATMEAL RAISIN CRISP COOKIES

                               Yield: 2 9x13-inch pans

         This recipe is from the August/September 1996 issue of "Taste of
         Home".  It was contributed by Annie Beiler, of Leola,
         Pennsylvania.  You will need an extremely large bowl for mixing
         this -- I use the largest of my metal mixing bowl set.  As with
         most Rice Krispie bar recipes, it's a sticky mess to work with,
         despite the recipe's optimistic "toss to coat" and "pour".


         9-1/2 cups crisp rice cereal
             5 cups quick-cooking oats
             2 cups (12 oz) chocolate chips
         1-1/2 cups raisins
             1 cup chopped peanuts
         1-1/2 pounds marshmallows
           1/4 cup butter or margarine
           1/2 cup honey
           1/4 cup vegetable oil
           1/4 cup peanut butter


         In a large bowl, combine the first five ingredients; set aside.
         In a large saucepan over low heat, cook and stir marshmallows and
         butter until smooth.  Add honey, oil, and peanut butter; mix well.
         Pour over cereal mixture; toss to coat.  Pour into two greased
         13-in.  x 9-in.  x 2-in.  baking pans; press firmly and evenly.
         Cool.

         Note:  I think the instructions could probably be simplified a
         little.  I don't see any reason that the honey, oil, and peanut
         butter couldn't be in the pan with the butter and marshmallows
         from the start.  And maybe the mixing would be easier if first
         the nuts and raisins were mixed with the melted mixture, then
         that mixture added to the other (pre-mixed) ingredients.


                              ORANGE-PECAN BUNDT CAKE

                             Yield: one 12-cup bundt pan

         This recipe is from "Family Circle" magazine.  The nuts in this
         recipe are ground, so they add texture rather than crunch.  You
         can't slice this quite as thinly as the Milk Chocolate Bundt Cake,
         but can probably get 25 to 30 slices per pan.

         Nutritional Analysis:  If the cake is cut into 16 slices, each
         slice contains 381 calories, 25 g fat (9 g saturated), 2 g fiber,
         5 g protein, 37 g carbohydrate, 213 mg sodium, 87 mg cholesterol


             1 (8-ounce) package pecan pieces
         1-1/2 cups sugar
           7/8 cup butter (1-3/4 sticks), softened
             4 eggs
             1 (8-ounce) container sour cream
           1/2 cup frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed
             2 tablespoons grated orange rind
             2 teaspoons vanilla
             2 cups flour
             1 teaspoon baking soda
           3/4 teaspoon salt
               Confectioners' sugar


         Process pecan pieces and 1/2 cup sugar in a food processor until
         finely ground.  Cream the butter with the remaining sugar.  Beat
         in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each.  Add sour cream,
         orange juice concentrate, orange rind, and vanilla.  Stir in pecan
         mixture.  Combine flour, baking soda, and salt, then stir in with
         the rest.  Spoon the batter into a greased and floured 12-cup
         bundt pan.  Bake at 350 degrees F. for 45 to 50 minutes or until
         a wooden pick inserted into the center comes out clean.  Let cake
         cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then remove from bundt pan to wire
         rack to cool completely.  Dust top with confectioners' sugar.


                        PEANUT BUTTER CHOCOLATE-CRUNCH TREATS

                           Yield: one 9-in x 13-in pan

         This recipe is from the 6/4/96 issue of "Woman's Day" magazine.
         I've changed the directions to make it a little easier to handle.
         The melting can be done on stovetop if you don't have a microwave.


             1 tablespoon butter
             1 package (10-1/2 ounces) miniature white marshmallows
           1/2 cup chunky peanut butter
             5 cups Rice Krispies or similar cereal
           1/2 cup semisweet chocolate mini-chips


         Grease a 9-in x 13-in baking pan.  Grease a large bowl, and put
         the Rice Krispies in it.  Put the butter and peanut butter in a
         large, microwave-safe bowl, and microwave until the butter is
         melted.  Stir well, then add the marshmallows.  Microwave about 45
         seconds on high, stir, then microwave until melted, about another
         45 seconds.  Stir until smooth, then immediately pour over the
         cereal in the bowl, and mix as best you can.  (I usually have to
         use my hands to finish the mixing.) Press the mixture into the
         prepared pan, making an even layer.  Sprinkle with chocolate chips
         and let cool completely before cutting.


                               PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES

                               Yield: about 4 dozen

         This is the recipe my mother used; I don't know where she got it.
         You can use either creamy or chunky peanut butter, depending on
         whether or not you want your cookies to be chunky.  Watch out for
         reduced-fat peanut butter, though -- that will not give the same
         texture.


             1 cup flour
           1/2 teaspoon baking soda
           1/4 teaspoon salt
           1/2 cup shortening
           1/2 cup packed brown sugar
           1/2 cup sugar
             1 egg
           1/2 cup peanut butter
             1 tablespoon water
           1/2 teaspoon vanilla


         Sift dry ingredients together.  Beat all other ingredients 2
         minutes.  Add dry ingredients and beat 1 minute more.  Drop by
         teaspoonfuls onto a greased cookie sheet.  Press lightly with a
         fork dipped in flour or water, making a criss-cross pattern.  Bake
         at 325 degrees for 8-10 minutes, or until done.


                                  POPPY SEED BREAD

                                   Yield: 2 loaves

         This recipe is from the June/July 1993 issue of "Taste of Home"
         magazine, and was contributed by Faye Hintz of Springfield,
         Missouri.  It takes a fair amount of elapsed time to prepare
         because of the need to cool completely before adding the glaze,
         but there's very little actual work involved.  Also, after you've
         made it once, you'll probably have all the ingredients on hand, so
         it's something nice that you can make without running to the
         store.


             3 cups flour
         2-1/4 cups sugar
         1-1/2 tablespoons poppy seeds
         1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder
         1-1/2 teaspoons salt
             3 eggs, lightly beaten
         1-1/2 cups milk
             1 cup vegetable oil
         1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
         1-1/2 teaspoons almond extract
         1-1/2 teaspoons butter extract
        Glaze:
           3/4 cup sugar
           1/4 cup orange juice
           1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
           1/2 teaspoon almond extract
           1/2 teaspoon butter extract


         In a large bowl, combine first five ingredients.  Add eggs, milk,
         oil, and extracts.  Pour into two greased 8-1/2-in.  x 4-1/2-in.
         x 2-1/2 in.  loaf pans.  Bake at 350 degrees for 60-65 minutes.
         Cool completely in pans.  In a small saucepan, bring all glaze
         ingredients to a boil.  Pour over bread in pans.  Cool for 5
         minutes; remove from pans and cool completely.


                                    PUMPKIN BREAD

                            Yield: 3 loaves or 42 muffins
                                   or 8 dozen mini-muffins


         This recipe came from the Montgomery County Office of the
         Cooperative Extension Service.  For home use, I frequently make a
         batch of one loaf and the rest muffins; for Courts of Honor, I
         make mini-muffins.  You will need a very large bowl for mixing
         this.  I can only fit four mini-muffin pans in my oven at once, so
         I refrigerate the remaining batter until the first set is done.


         3-1/2 cups flour
             2 teaspoons baking soda
         1-1/2 teaspoons salt
             2 teaspoons cinnamon
             1 teaspoon nutmeg
             1 teaspoon allspice
             2 cups pumpkin
             1 cup oil
             3 cups sugar
         1-1/2 cups raisins
             4 eggs
           2/3 cup water
         1-1/2 cups chopped nuts


         Sift dry ingredients together.  Mix all remaining ingredients.
         Gradually add dry ingredients to mixture.  Bake in 3 loaf pans at
         350 degrees for 50 minutes.  (Muffins will take less time -- about
         half an hour; 20 minutes for mini-muffins.) Cool.  Wrap loaves in
         foil (?  I don't know why they say this.  Plastic wrap is fine.)
         and store in refrigerator (again, not really necessary, but then,
         I usually freeze whatever we won't use within a couple of days).


                                RICH 'N' BUTTERY BARS

                            Yield: 13-in x 9-in x 2-in pan


         This recipe came from the July/August 1998 issue of "Quick
         Cooking" magazine.  It was contributed by Ann Horst of Boonsboro,
         Maryland.  Personally, I feel the cake mix results in an
         unpleasantly artificial taste, but most people don't seem to mind.
         Because of the cream cheese in the filling, I would recommend
         refrigerating any left-overs.


           1/2 cup cold butter or margarine
             1 package (18-1/4 ounces) yellow cake mix
             1 egg, beaten
         Filling:
             1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, softened
             2 cups confectioners' sugar
             2 eggs
             1 teaspoon vanilla extract
         Additional confectioners' sugar


         In a bowl, cut butter into cake mix until crumbly.  Add egg and
         mix well.  Press into a greased 13x9x2-inch pan.  In a mixing
         bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar.  Add eggs and vanilla; beat
         until smooth.  Spread evenly over the crust.  Bake at 350 degrees
         for 30 minutes, then reduce heat to 325 degrees and bake 10
         minutes longer.  Dust with confectioners' sugar while warm.  Cool
         to room temperature before cutting.


                             SCOTTISH SHORTBREAD COOKIES

                             Yield: about 4 dozen cookies

         This recipe came from a butter advertisement.  The way that I
         usually flatten the cookies is to use the bottom of a cookie press
         -- just the ring that holds the plate and the "swirl" design
         plate.  I hold it upside down, gently press a ball of dough onto
         the middle of the plate, then turn it over and flatten the dough
         onto the sheet.  The feet of the cookie press keep the cookies all
         the same thickness, and putting the ball of dough on the plate
         rather than directly on the sheet helps me to get them centered
         properly.  I've tried other designs, and they don't work as well.


           1/4 cup sugar
           1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
         1-1/4 cups cold butter (2-1/2 sticks)  (not margarine)
         2-1/2 cups flour

         Heat oven to 275 degrees.  Place sugars in food processor and
         process until very fine.  Add butter, cut into 8-10 pieces; pulse
         until sugar disappears.  Add flour; pulse until no dry flour
         particles remain.  (Mixture will be moist and crumbly.) Place in
         plastic bag and press together to form dough; knead lightly until
         dough holds together.  Remove from bag.  Shape dough into 1-inch
         balls.  Place on ungreased cookie sheets 2 inches apart.  Flatten
         each with a cookie press, fork, or the bottom of a glass lightly
         moistened with water.  Bake 45 minutes to 1 hour or until pale
         golden.  Remove from cookie sheets and cool completely on wire
         racks.


                                 SHANGHAI SHORT CAKE

                             Yield: 15-1/2 x 10-1/2 pan

         This recipe is from "The Cookie Cookbook" by Evelyne Johnson, a
         1979 Dell Purse Book.  It is attributed to Virginia Lee, allegedly
         a famous Chinese cooking teacher and author.  It makes a lot of
         cookies quickly.  They are not quite as good as the Scottish
         Shortbread, but are still an acceptable shortbread.


             3 cups flour
           1/2 cup cornstarch
             2 cups butter (4 sticks)  (not margarine)
             1 cup confectioners' sugar
             2 teaspoons vanilla

         Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Stir flour and cornstarch togeher,
         and set aside.  Cream butter and sugar until very fluffy.  Add
         flour mixture and vanilla.  Pat into pan and bake 30 to 35
         minutes.  Cut into 1-inch squares.


                                SPLIT-SECOND COOKIES

                               Yield: about 50 cookies

         This recipe was contributed to "Yankee" magazine by Johanna
         Hurwitz, of Great Neck, New York.  She attributed it to her Aunt
         Clara Morris.  The aunt called them "split-second" because she
         could make them so quickly, but Ms.  Hurwitz says it also applies
         to the speed with which they disappear.  The first time you make
         them, it will not be quite so quick, since you need to get used to
         the method.  The result does look very fancy (and they taste good,
         too).  Plan ahead -- these cool on the baking sheet, so make them
         last if you're making other things that need the sheets too, or
         line the sheet with foil or parchment, so you can slide everything
         off together.


             2 cups flour
           1/2 teaspoon baking powder
           2/3 cup sugar
           3/4 cup butter
             1 egg
             1 teaspoon vanilla extract (or 1/2 teaspoon lemon or almond extract)
           1/3 cup jam (approximately)

         Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Mix flour, baking pwder, and sugar.
         Blend in butter, egg, and extract.  Place dough on lightly floured
         board and divide into 4 parts.  Shape each in a roll about 13
         inches long.  Place rolls on an ungreased baking sheet 4 inches
         apart and 2 inches from the edge.  Pat down so that you have a
         strip about 3/4 inch thick.  Use a knife handle (not a pointy
         one!) to make a length-wise depression, about 3/8 inch deep, down
         the center of each strip.  (Be careful not to go too deep, or the
         finished cookies will tend to break apart at the middle.) Fill the
         depression with jam.  Bake until brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.
         Cut into bars while still warm, but leave them on the cookie
         sheets until they are cool.


                                    SUGAR COOKIES

                         Yield:  varies with size of cookies


         This is my family's traditional Christmas sugar cookie recipe.  My
         mother got it from her oldest sister.  The mace gives them an
         unusual flavor.  This is a harder cookie than most sugar cookies,
         so be sure to roll the dough thin.  The recipe says that you could
         use a cookie press, but I've never tried that.


             1 cup butter
             2 cups sugar
             2 eggs
             1 teaspoon mace
             1 teaspoon vanilla
           1/2 teaspoon baking powder
         3-1/2 cups flour


         Cream the butter, and gradually add the sugar.  Add the eggs, one
         at a time, beating well.  Add the mace, vanilla, and baking
         powder.  Add the flour until thick.  Roll out and cut or press.
         (For rolled cookies, I usually divide the dough into fourths,
         wrap, and chill it first.  Then, work with one portion of dough at
         a time.  Depending on how cold your refrigerator is and how long
         the dough has been in there, you may need to take the dough out a
         half-hour or so before attempting to roll it.) Bake at 450 degrees
         for 6 to 8 minutes.  (Keep a close watch -- these cookies will go
         from just right to overdone very quickly.)


                                 SWEET ALMOND BREAD

                               Yield:  2 round loaves


         This was contributed to "Quick Cooking" magazine by Sally Ball,
         from Gladwin, Michigan.  She recommends using it as a breakfast
         bread, or warm with ice cream.  There aren't actually any almonds
         in the bread, only in the decoration.  I've cut the amount of
         liquid topping in half from her recipe, since it was making far
         more than was needed.  This bread increases in volume impressively
         once you put it in the oven to bake.


         DOUGH:
           2/3 cup warm milk (70 to 80 degrees)
             1 egg yolk  (actually you can use a whole egg, if you like)
           1/4 cup butter, softened  (melt it if you don't have a bread maker)
           1/4 cup applesauce, room temperature
           1/3 cup sugar
           1/2 teaspoon salt
         2-3/4 cups bread flour
             1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
         TOPPING:
             2 tablespoons butter
         1-1/2 tablespoons sugar
         1-1/2 teaspoons milk
           1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
               dash salt
             6 tablespoons sliced almonds


         In bread machine pan, place dough ingredients in order suggested
         by manufacturer.  Select dough setting (check dough after 5
         minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons of flour if needed.)
         When cycle is completed, turn dough onto a floured surface and
         punch down.  Divide dough in half.  Roll each portion into a
         6-inch circle and place on greased baking sheets.  (Use something
         with a rim around it, like a jelly roll pan.  Don't try
         substituting 8-inch round pans; the topping will make a mess of
         them.) Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30
         minutes (usually longer in my house).  Meanwhile, for topping,
         combine butter, sugar, milk, cinnamon, and salt in a small
         saucepan.  Cook and stir over low heat until butter is melted.
         Simmer for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat, cool for 5 minutes.
         Make a 1/4 inch depression in the center of each loaf with the tip
         of a wooden spoon.  Brush with butter mixture and sprinkle with
         almonds.  Bake at 375 degrees for 18-20 minutes or until golden
         brown.  Cool for 10 minutes.  May be served warm or cool.

         Note:  I don't have a bread machine.  I start by combining
         everything except the flour in a bowl, then adding about 2 cups of
         flour until the dough is thick enough to knead, and kneading in
         the rest.  I also usually give it a "first rising" of an hour or
         so, then punch down and proceed as if I had just removed it from
         the bread machine.


                                 TOFFEE-TOPPED BARS

                                Yield:  13x9-inch pan


         This recipe was on a "Great American Home Baking" card that came
         in the mail -- part of a set that they hoped you would want to
         subscribe to.  These bars look luscious, with the nuts and
         chocolate chips on top, but the base is a sort of thin cake,
         rather than being more cookie-like (as I would prefer).  Other
         folks seem to like them fine, though.  The toppings fall off
         easily; it may help if you gently press them down into the batter
         before baking.  Then again, with the thick layer of crumbs between
         the topping and the batter, that may make no difference.


             2 cups firmly packed brown sugar
             2 cups flour
           1/2 cup butter, softened
             1 teaspoon baking powder
           1/2 teaspoon salt
             1 teaspoon vanilla extract
             1 cup milk
             1 egg
             1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
           1/2 cup chopped walnuts
           1/4 cup unsweetened flaked coconut (optional)


         In a large mixing bowl, mix together the brown sugar and flour.
         Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
         Remove 1 cup of crumbs and set aside.  To the mixture in the large
         bowl, add the baking powder and salt, then lightly beat in the
         vanilla, milk, and egg.  Pour batter into a greased 13x9-inch
         baking pan.  Sprinkle the reserved crumbs over the top of the
         batter; then the chocolate chips, walnuts, and coconut (if used).
         (I recommend that you try gently pressing the toppings into the
         batter at this point, in the hope that they won't fall off so
         easily afterwards.) Bake at 350 degrees for 35 minutes, or until a
         skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool in the pan on
         a wire rack before slicing.  Store in an airtight container for up
         to 5 days.


                                 VALENTINE CUTOUTS

                                Yield:  13x9-inch pan


         This recipe came from "Taste of Home" magazine.  It was
         contributed by Annette Ellyson of Carolina, West Virginia.  I made
         it for a fall Court of Honor, so I just cut it into squares,
         instead of hearts.  And I think I used one package of cherry and
         one package of grape gelatin; you could use other flavors, too.


             2 packages (6 oz. each) cherry or raspberry gelatin
         2-1/2 cups boiling water
             1 cup cold milk
             1 package (3.4 oz.) instant vanilla pudding mix


         In a bowl, dissolve gelatin in water; set aside for 30 minutes.
         In a small bowl, whisk milk and pudding mix until smooth, about
         1 minute.  Quickly pour into gelatin; whisk until well blended.
         Pour into an oiled 13-in x 9-in. x 2-in. dish.  Chill until set.
         Cut into cubes or use a heart-shaped cutter.


                                 WALNUT-RAISIN BREAD

                                   Yield:  1 loaf


         This recipe came from "Country" magazine.  It was submitted by
         Charles Stuller, of Winter Haven, Florida.  I found that the
         bottom of this loaf tended to burn if I used a glass loaf pan.  My
         cure was to wrap the bottom of the loaf pan with some aluminum
         foil, and use a slightly longer total cooking time (at least 70
         minutes).  Or, you could try reducing the temperature a little.


             2 cups flour
             1 teaspoon baking powder
           1/2 teaspoon baking soda
           1/2 teaspoon salt
           1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
           3/4 cup sugar
             1 egg
           1/4 cup orange juice
             1 can (8 ounces) crushed pineapple, undrained
             1 cup raisins
             1 cup chopped walnuts


         In a mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and
         salt; set aside.  In another bowl, cream butter and sugar.  Add
         egg and orange juice; beat well.  Add 1/3 cup of flour mixture;
         beat until smooth.  Mix in remaining flour mixture and the
         pineapple.  Stir in raisins and walnuts.  Pour into a greased 9-in
         x 5-in x 3-in loaf pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for 60-70 minutes.
         Let cool in pan for 10 minutes.  Remove to a wire rack to cool
         completely.


                               WHITE TEXAS SHEET CAKE

                           Yield: 15-in x 10-in x 1-in pan


         This is another recipe from the "Taste of Home" magazine.  It was
         contributed by Joanie Ward, of Brownsburg, Indiana.  She says that
         the cake gets better the longer it sits, so she tries to make it a
         day ahead.  This is a very easy recipe -- you don't even have to
         get the butter out to soften ahead of time, since it is melted for
         both the cake and the icing.  If you don't have walnuts on hand,
         try pecans.


             1 cup butter or margarine
             1 cup water
             2 cups flour
             2 cups sugar
             2 eggs, beaten
           1/2 cup sour cream
             1 teaspoon almond extract
             1 teaspoon salt
             1 teaspoon baking soda
         FROSTING:
           1/2 cup butter or margarine
           1/4 cup milk
         4-1/2 cups confectioners' sugar      (that's a whole one-pound box)
           1/2 teaspoon almond extract
             1 cup chopped walnuts


         In a large saucepan, bring butter and water to a boil.  Remove
         from the heat, stir in flour, sugar, eggs, sour cream, almond
         extract, salt, and baking soda until smooth.  Pour into a greased
         15-in x 10-in x 1-in baking pan (commonly called a "jelly roll"
         pan).  Bake at 375 degrees for 20-22 minutes or until cake is
         golden brown and tests done.  Cool for 20 minutes.

         Meanwhile, for frosting, combine butter and milk in a saucepan.
         Bring to a boil.  Remove from the heat; add sugar and extract and
         mix well.  Stir in walnuts; spread over warm cake.  Makes 16-20
         servings.


                                    WHOOPIE PIES

                                 Yield: 5 to 6 dozen


         These are cake-like chocolate cookies with a light, fluffy filling.
         Janet Heathcote contributed the recipe to the "Over the Line Cook
         Book" published by the Maryland Line Methodist Church.  Apparently,
         it must be a regional delicacy, since several people at the first
         affair where I served it mentioned that they had had them before in
         Pennsylvania, but had never encountered them down here.  Some knew
         them as "gobs".  When they're first filled, they're messy to eat,
         but after several hours they become reasonably manageable.  Since
         the filling is not cooked, don't use raw egg whites -- you can
         find dry egg white powder in the bakery aisle.


             1 cup shortening
             2 cups sugar
             2 eggs
             1 cup sour milk
             1 teaspoon vanilla
             4 cups flour
             1 cup cocoa
             2 teaspoons salt
             2 teaspoons baking soda
             1 cup hot water
         FILLING:
             2 egg whites, beaten
             2 tablespoons vanilla (yes, really!)
             2 tablespoons flour
             2 tablespoons milk
             4 cups confectioners' sugar  (see note)
             1 cup shortening or butter


         Cookies:  Cream sugar and shortening.  Add eggs and beat.  Add
         sour milk and vanilla.  Sift flour, cocoa, salt and add to
         mixture.  Dissolve soda in hot water and add to mixture.  Drop by
         teaspoonfuls on greased baking sheets.  Bake at 400 degrees for 8
         to 10 minutes.

         Filling:  The recipe doesn't specify how much to beat the egg
         whites.  It may not matter; I tried for soft peaks.  Then add the
         vanilla.  You may be worried at the time, because it is so much
         vanilla, and makes the mixture rather brown-looking, but it will
         be much lighter in color by the time you're done.  Then add flour,
         milk, and 2 cups of the confectioners' sugar.  Beat "to a cream"
         and add the remaining sugar and shortening.  Beat until smooth and
         fluffy.  Spread generously between two of the chocolate cookies.
         Allow several hours for softening before serving them.

         Note:  To sift, or not to sift?  The recipe didn't specify.  The
         first time I made these, I sifted the confectioners' sugar, and
         found that I had to add a bit extra in order to get the right
         consistency in the filling -- although I thought that might have
         been from using part butter.  The next time, I didn't sift, and I
         think the filling was a little bit less moist than would have been
         ideal.  So probably, you want a little more than 4 cups if you
         sift, and a little less than 4 cups if you don't.


                              ZUCCHINI CHOCOLATE CAKE

                           Yield: 13-in x 9-in x 2-in pan


         This is yet another recipe from the "Taste of Home" magazine.  It
         was contributed by Leon Kingsley, of Marshfield, Mass.  I have
         seen a muffin recipe elsewhere that is identical except for
         omitting the baking powder.  The recipe originally just said
         "chocolate chips", but I think that the mini-chips work better --
         the big ones make it harder to cut neatly.  For that matter, since
         these is a fairly tender (crumbly) cake, it's a lot less messy to
         cut if you stick it in the freezer for a little while first.


           1/2 cup butter, softened
           1/2 cup vegetable oil
         1-3/4 cups sugar
             2 eggs
             1 teaspoon vanilla extract
         2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
           1/4 cup baking cocoa
             1 teaspoon baking soda
           1/2 teaspoon baking powder
           1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
           1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
           1/2 cup sour milk  (1-1/2 teaspns vinegar plus milk to 1/2 cup)
             2 cups shredded peeled zucchini
           1/2 cups semisweet mini chocolate chips


         In a mixing bowl, cream butter, oil, and sugar.  Beat in eggs and
         vanilla.  Combine dry ingredients; add to the creamed mixture
         alternately with milk.  Mix well.  Stir in zucchini.  Pour into a
         greased 13-in.  x 9-in.  x 2-in.  baking pan.  Sprinkle with
         chocolate chips.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until
         a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.  Cool on a
         wire rack.


                                BLACK CHERRY PUNCH


         This recipe came from a "Food Writers' Favorites" book on
         beverages, 'alcohol-free drinks for all occasions'.  It was
         copyrighted by Dial Publishing Company in 1992, and may have
         originally been promoted by Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
         (My copy came from a used book sale.)  The recipe was contributed
         by Clara Eschmann, of Macon, Georgia.  I suspect it could be
         streamlined by starting out with cherry or cherry-apple juice,
         rather than boiling the cherries.  The cinnamon and fresh ginger
         give this a sophisticated touch -- probably more appreciated by
         adults than by young Scouts.


             2 cups pitted fresh or frozen sweet black cherries
             6 cups water, divided
             1 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger
             1 stick (2 inches) cinnamon, broken into small pieces
             1 cup sugar
           1/4 cup lemon juice


         In a saucepan, combine cherries and 2 cups water.  Bring to a
         boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, covered, 15 minutes.  Set aside
         to cool.  In another saucepan, combine remaining 4 cups water,
         ginger, cinnamon, and sugar.  Bring to a boil and boil 3 minutes.
         Let cool.  Strain to remove the ginger and cinnamon.  Place
         cooled cherries in a sieve and drain off juices, bruising fruit
         gently in order to get as much flavor as possible into the juice.
         Drain 20 minutes or longer.  Discard bruised cherries.  Combine
         cherry juice with strained mixture, add lemon juice, mix well,
         and refrigerate until ready to serve.

         Note -- I switched the sugar from added at the end to boiled
         with the spices.


                                FRANKENSTEIN'S PUNCH


         This recipe came from either "Family Circle" or "Woman's Day"
         magazine, in the fall of 1998.  (I don't remember which.) The name
         refers to an optional decoration for the punch glasses, which is
         not of interest here.  The selzer is not in the original recipe,
         but I recommend adding it, to taste, to make the punch more
         refreshing and less cloyingly sweet.


         2-1/2 cups cold ginger ale
             2 cups cold white grape juice
             2 cups lemonade
             1 or more cups selzer, optional


         Combine all ingredients.


                                MOCK CHAMPAGNE PUNCH


         This recipe came from the December/January issue of "Taste of Home"
         magazine.  It was contributed by Betty Claycomb, of Alverton,
         Pennsylvania.  This is about as easy as you could ask, and very
         popular with both boys and adults.  You can also use red grape
         juice.


             1 quart white grape juice, chilled
             1 quart ginger ale, chilled


         Combine all ingredients.  (Garnish with strawberry slices or
         raspberries, if desired.)

         Note:  I have made a "slushifed" version of this by adapting
         the instructions for "Slush Punch for a Crowd".  I used white
         grape juice in place of the pineapple juice and white grape
         "sparkling" jello.

         Additional note:  the white grape jello is getting hard to find.
         If you can't get it, you can substitute plain gelatin and extra
         white grape juice.  I better give the details of that here, since
         I didn't get it quite right doing the substitution on the fly.
             Use two 64-ounce containers of white grape juice.
             Sprinkle 2 packages of plain gelatin on 1 cup of the grape
               juice to soften.
             Meanwhile, boil 2 cups of water.
             Stir the boiling water into the gelatin, then add 2 cups of
               sugar, then the rest of the juice.



                                PASSIONFRUIT PUNCH


         This scarcely deserves to be dignified with a recipe, but has been
         well-received on many occasions.  Don't forget to bring the
         can opener with which to pry the lid off of the concentrate.


             1 liter selzer  (I use Vintage brand)
             1 can frozen passionfruit punch concentrate, thawed


         Put the selzer in the serving container and add the concentrate.
         (It fizzes less this way than if you do it the other way around.)
         Stir gently.


                                 PINEAPPLE COOLER


         This recipe was sent to "Quick Cooking" magazine by Michelle
         Blumberg, of Littlerock, California.  The lemon juice helps cut
         the sweetness; but you will still probably want to add a little
         selzer to tone it down.


             1 cup unsweetened pinapple juice, chilled
             1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice
             1 can (12 ounces) lemon-lime soda, chilled
               selzer as needed


         Combine all ingredients and shake or stir well.


                              SLUSH PUNCH FOR A CROWD


         This recipe came from a "Food Writers' Favorites" book on
         beverages, 'alcohol-free drinks for all occasions'.  It was
         copyrighted by Dial Publishing Company in 1992, and may have
         originally been promoted by Mothers Against Drunk Driving.  (My
         copy came from a used book sale.) The recipe was contributed by
         Jane Gray, of Ludington, Michigan.  The color and flavor of this
         punch can be varied somewhat by using different flavors of Jello,
         but I suspect the pineapple will always be predominant.  When made
         with cherry Jello, the flavor is much like Hawaiian Punch.  Orange
         is particularly good.  The slushiness is good for the typical
         Scout occasion, when you want to set up before some event that the
         refreshments will follow; the punch will stay cold in the interim.
         I divide the punch base evenly among four 2-quart containers
         for freezing; then each container will mix with 1 liter of
         ginger ale.


             2 cups granulated sugar
             6 cups water
             1 package (6 ounces) flavored gelatin
             2 cans (46 ounces each) pineapple juice
             4 liters ginger ale, chilled


         Combine sugar and water, heat to a boil and boil 3 minutes.  Put
         gelatin in a 6-quart container, add boiling water, and stir until
         gelatin is dissolved.  Add pineapple juice.  Mix well.  Pour into
         plastic containers and freeze ('at least 24 hours').  'About an
         hour before serving time', put out containers to thaw slightly.
         The original recipe said to empty the containers into a large
         punch bowl and break the mixture into chunks with a wooden spoon.
         I think it works better if you break up the mixture in the
         container it was frozen in (preferably at home, just before
         leaving), then put it in the punch bowl.  Add ginger ale, and mix
         to a slushy consistency.

         Notes -- The original recipe just called for mixing the gelatin
         and sugar, then mixing in the boiling water.  I put the sugar
         in the water, then boil, because that usually gives a better-
         tasting drink.  My freezer must be colder than the one the
         recipe-writer was using; I don't think it really takes 24 hours
         to freeze, and I need to get the punch base out of the freezer
         about 3 hours before use unless it's a really hot day.


                              SPARKLING GRAPE PUNCH


         This is an especially delicious mixture.  It was contributed to
         "Quick Cooking" magazine by Arlyn Kramer, of Dumas, Arkansas.  The
         recipe claims a yield of "5-1/2 quarts", but I don't see any way
         to make it add up to that much.  I had thought that perhaps it
         should have been 2 2-liter bottles of ginger ale, instead of just
         2 liters, but found it doesn't taste as good if you use more than
         2 liters.  Anyway, it looks to me more like 3-1/2 quarts.


             2 cups water
             1 cup sugar
             2 cups grape juice, chilled
             1 cup orange juice, chilled
             2 liters ginger ale, chilled


         In a saucepan, combine water and sugar.  Bring to a boil; boil for
         3 minutes.  Cool.  Add juices and mix well.  Stir in ginger ale
         just before serving.
