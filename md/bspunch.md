- 2 cups pitted fresh or frozen sweet black cherries
- 6 cups water, divided
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger
- 1 stick (2 inches) cinnamon, broken into small pieces
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup lemon juice

In a saucepan, combine cherries and 2 cups water.  Bring to a
boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, covered, 15 minutes.  Set aside
to cool.  In another saucepan, combine remaining 4 cups water,
ginger, cinnamon, and sugar.  Bring to a boil and boil 3 minutes.
Let cool.  Strain to remove the ginger and cinnamon.  Place
cooled cherries in a sieve and drain off juices, bruising fruit
gently in order to get as much flavor as possible into the juice.
Drain 20 minutes or longer.  Discard bruised cherries.  Combine
cherry juice with strained mixture, add lemon juice, mix well,
and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Note — I switched the sugar from added at the end to boiled
with the spices.


Frankenstein's Punch
--------------------

> This recipe came from either "Family Circle" or "Woman's Day"
> magazine, in the fall of 1998.  (I don't remember which.) The name
> refers to an optional decoration for the punch glasses, which is
> not of interest here.  The selzer is not in the original recipe,
> but I recommend adding it, to taste, to make the punch more
> refreshing and less cloyingly sweet.

- 2+1/2 cups cold ginger ale
- 2 cups cold white grape juice
- 2 cups lemonade
- 1 or more cups selzer, optional

Combine all ingredients.


Mock Champagne Punch
--------------------

> This recipe came from the December/January issue of "Taste of Home"
> magazine.  It was contributed by Betty Claycomb, of Alverton,
> Pennsylvania.  This is about as easy as you could ask, and very
> popular with both boys and adults.  You can also use red grape
> juice.

- 1 quart white grape juice, chilled
- 1 quart ginger ale, chilled

Combine all ingredients.  (Garnish with strawberry slices or
raspberries, if desired.

Note:  I have made a "slushified" version of this by adapting
the instructions for "Slush Punch for a Crowd".  I used white
grape juice in place of the pineapple juice and white grape
"sparkling" jello.

Additional note:  the white grape jello is getting hard to find.
If you can't get it, you can substitute plain gelatin and extra
white grape juice.  I better give the details of that here, since
I didn't get it quite right doing the substitution on the fly.

Use two 64-ounce containers of white grape juice.
Sprinkle 2 packages of plain gelatin on 1 cup of the grape juice
to soften. Meanwhile, boil 2 cups of water.
Stir the boiling water into the gelatin, then add 2 cups of
sugar, then the rest of the juice.


Passionfruit Punch
------------------

> This scarcely deserves to be dignified with a recipe, but has been
> well-received on many occasions.  Don't forget to bring the
> can opener with which to pry the lid off of the concentrate.

- 1 liter selzer  (I use Vintage brand)
- 1 can frozen passionfruit punch concentrate, thawed

Put the selzer in the serving container and add the concentrate.
(It fizzes less this way than if you do it the other way around.)
Stir gently.


Pineapple Cooler
----------------

> This recipe was sent to "Quick Cooking" magazine by Michelle
> Blumberg, of Littlerock, California.  The lemon juice helps cut
> the sweetness; but you will still probably want to add a little
> selzer to tone it down.

- 1 cup unsweetened pinapple juice, chilled
- 1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 can (12 ounces) lemon-lime soda, chilled
- selzer as needed

Combine all ingredients and shake or stir well.


Slush Punch for a Crowd
-----------------------

> The color and flavor of this
> punch can be varied somewhat by using different flavors of Jello,
> but I suspect the pineapple will always be predominant.  When made

> refreshments will follow; the punch will stay cold in the interim.
> I divide the punch base evenly among four 2-quart containers
> for freezing; then each container will mix with 1 liter of
> ginger ale.

- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 6 cups water
- 1 package (6 ounces) flavored gelatin
- 2 cans (46 ounces each) pineapple juice
- 4 liters ginger ale, chilled

Combine sugar and water, heat to a boil and boil 3 minutes.  Put
gelatin in a 6-quart container, add boiling water, and stir until
gelatin is dissolved.  Add pineapple juice.  Mix well.  Pour into
plastic containers and freeze ("at least 24 hours").  "About an
hour before serving time," put out containers to thaw slightly.
The original recipe said to empty the containers into a large
punch bowl and break the mixture into chunks with a wooden spoon.
I think it works better if you break up the mixture in the
container it was frozen in (preferably at home, just before
leaving), then put it in the punch bowl.  Add ginger ale, and mix
to a slushy consistency.

Notes — The original recipe just called for mixing the gelatin
and sugar, then mixing in the boiling water.  I put the sugar
in the water, then boil, because that usually gives a better-
tasting drink.  My freezer must be colder than the one the
recipe-writer was using; I don't think it really takes 24 hours
to freeze, and I need to get the punch base out of the freezer
about 3 hours before use unless it's a really hot day.


Sparkling Grape Punch
---------------------

This is an especially delicious mixture.  It was contributed to
"Quick Cooking" magazine by Arlyn Kramer, of Dumas, Arkansas.  The
recipe claims a yield of "5+1/2 quarts", but I don't see any way
to make it add up to that much.  I had thought that perhaps it
should have been 2 2-liter bottles of ginger ale, instead of just
2 liters, but found it doesn't taste as good if you use more than
2 liters.  Anyway, it looks to me more like 3+1/2 quarts.

- 2 cups water
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 cups grape juice, chilled
- 1 cup orange juice, chilled
- 2 liters ginger ale, chilled

In a saucepan, combine water and sugar.  Bring to a boil; boil for
3 minutes.  Cool.  Add juices and mix well.  Stir in ginger ale
just before serving.
